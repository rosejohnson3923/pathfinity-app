# Companion & Career Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed
Based on the Issue.pdf document, the following problems have been resolved:

### 1. ‚úÖ Companion Undefined Issue
**Problem**: Companion was showing as undefined in the Learn container console logs.

**Root Cause**: The `selectedCharacter` prop was being passed as a string (companion name) but the code was trying to access it as an object.

**Fix Applied** in `AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before
const characterId = selectedCharacter ? selectedCharacter.toLowerCase() : (currentCharacter?.id || 'finn');

// After - Handle both string names and undefined values
const characterId = selectedCharacter ? 
  (typeof selectedCharacter === 'string' ? selectedCharacter.toLowerCase() : selectedCharacter.id) : 
  (currentCharacter?.id || 'finn');
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Career Display Issue
**Problem**: Header was showing "Exploring undefined Career" instead of the actual career name.

**Root Cause**: 
1. The career object was being passed correctly but not displayed in the UI header
2. The title was only showing the skill name, not including the career context

**Fix Applied** in `AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before
<ContainerNavigationHeader
  title={skill.name}
  ...
/>

// After - Construct title with career and skill
const title = `Exploring ${career || 'Career'} through ${skill?.skill_name || skill?.name || 'Learning'}`;

<ContainerNavigationHeader
  title={title}
  ...
/>
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Skill Name Issue
**Problem**: `skill.name` was undefined, causing the header to not display properly.

**Root Cause**: The skill object from `MultiSubjectContainerV2` uses `skill_name` property, but the Learn container was trying to access `skill.name`.

**Fix Applied**: The title now checks for both `skill?.skill_name` and `skill?.name` as fallbacks.

## Debug Logging Added
To help diagnose future issues, comprehensive debug logging has been added:

1. **AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx**:
   ```typescript
   console.log('üîç AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED Props:', {
     hasStudent: !!student,
     hasSkill: !!skill,
     studentGrade: student?.grade_level,
     skillName: skill?.skill_name || skill?.name,
     selectedCharacter,
     selectedCareerObj: selectedCareer,
     characterType: typeof selectedCharacter,
     version: 'UNIFIED'
   });
   
   console.log('üé≠ Companion resolution:', {
     selectedCharacter,
     characterId,
     resolvedCharacter: character?.name,
     career
   });
   ```

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx`
   - Fixed companion resolution logic (lines 194-196)
   - Added career to header title (lines 867-868)
   - Added debug logging (lines 124-133, 201-206)

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the test file: `test-companion-career-fix.html`
3. Login as Sam (K), Jordan (7), or Taylor (10)
4. Select a career and companion
5. Navigate to Learn container
6. Verify in console:
   - No undefined values for companion or career
   - Header shows: "Exploring [Career] through [Skill]"
   - All debug logs show proper values

## Expected Console Output
```javascript
üîç AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED Props: {
  hasStudent: true,
  hasSkill: true,
  studentGrade: '7',
  skillName: 'Addition and Subtraction',
  selectedCharacter: 'finn',
  selectedCareerObj: {id: 'doctor', name: 'Doctor'},
  characterType: 'string',
  version: 'UNIFIED'
}

üé≠ Companion resolution: {
  selectedCharacter: 'finn',
  characterId: 'finn',
  resolvedCharacter: 'Finn',
  career: 'Doctor'
}
```

## Visual Confirmation
The header in the Learn container should now display:
- **Before**: "Exploring undefined Career"
- **After**: "Exploring Doctor through Addition and Subtraction"
