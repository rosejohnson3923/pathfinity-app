# Demo vs Production Lesson Plan Generation: Comprehensive Gap Analysis & Retrofit Plan

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** Research Complete - Implementation Pending
**Business Impact:** CRITICAL - Customer confusion due to quality gap

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

**The Quality Gap:** The DemonstrativeMasterNarrativeGenerator (Demo) creates significantly richer, more detailed lesson plans than MasterNarrativeGenerator (Production), causing customer confusion when production lessons don't match the quality shown during sales/onboarding.

**Critical Differences:**
1. **Demo has 11 enhancement layers** that Production lacks entirely
2. **Demo includes parent-facing value propositions** not in Production
3. **Demo provides detailed personalization examples** missing from Production
4. **Demo offers comprehensive quality markers** absent in Production
5. **Demo uses pre-selected showcase careers** vs Production's student-chosen careers

**Impact on User Experience:**
- Parents expect the richness they saw in demos
- Students receive less immersive experiences than promised
- Teachers lack the detailed context shown in previews
- Reduced engagement due to simpler narratives

**Risk Assessment for Retrofit:**
- **Technical Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM - Demo extends Production, clean inheritance
- **Breaking Changes:** LOW - Enhancements are additive, not replacement
- **Performance Risk:** MEDIUM - More detailed content = more AI tokens
- **Business Risk:** HIGH if not done - continued customer dissatisfaction

---

### 1.2 AI Learning Journey Architecture

#### AILearningJourneyService
**Location:** `/src/services/AILearningJourneyService.ts`

**Purpose:** Generates AI-powered content for all 3 containers

**Key Capabilities:**
- Uses PromptBuilder for hierarchical rule application
- Supports narrative context from MasterNarrative
- Maintains storyline continuity via cache
- Generates adaptive content based on performance

**Content Generation Methods:**
1. `generateLearnContent()` - Learn container with practice → instruction → assessment
2. `generateExperienceContent()` - Career scenario challenges
3. `generateDiscoverContent()` - Discovery paths and activities

**Narrative Context Integration:**
```typescript
// Receives narrative context from MasterNarrative
const narrativeContext = (career as any)?.narrativeContext;
const storylineContext = this.getStorylineContext(
  skillKey,
  skill,
  career,
  narrativeContext
);
```

**Gap:** Production narrative lacks the rich context Demo provides, so even though AILearningJourneyService CAN use it, Production doesn't GIVE it enough data.

---

### 1.3 Just-In-Time (JIT) Content Generation

#### JustInTimeContentService
**Location:** `/src/services/content/JustInTimeContentService.ts`

**Purpose:** On-demand content generation with caching

**Features:**
- Intelligent caching (memory + session)
- Performance-based adaptation
- Consistency validation
- Preloading for next containers

**Critical Integration Point:**
```typescript
// Checks for narrative context before AI generation
const hasRequiredData = request.context?.skill?.skill_name &&
                       request.context?.student?.grade_level &&
                       request.context?.career;

if (hasRequiredData) {
  const aiContent = await this.generateAIContent(request);
  // Uses AILearningJourneyService
}
```

**Gap:** JIT service is ready to use rich narrative context, but Production narrative doesn't provide it at Demo's level of detail.

---

### 1.4 Container Implementations (JIT Integration)

#### Learn Container (JIT-enabled)
**Location:** `/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainerV2-JIT.tsx`

**Features:**
- Uses JIT service for content generation
- Passes narrative context from daily learning context
- Tracks performance for adaptive content
- Validates consistency

**Narrative Context Flow:**
```typescript
// Creates/retrieves daily context
dailyContext = dailyContextManager.createDailyContext({
  id: student.id,
  grade: student.grade_level,
  currentSkill: skill,
  selectedCareer: { ... },
  companion: character,
  enrolledSubjects: [...]
});

// Passes to JIT for content generation
const generatedContent = await jitService.generateContainerContent({
  userId: student.id,
  container: containerId.current,
  containerType: 'learn',
  subject: skill.subject,
  performanceContext,
  context: {
    skill: { ... },
    student: { ... },
    career: ...,
    narrativeContext: dailyContext.narrativeContext  // ← Limited by Production
  }
});
```

**Gap:** Container passes `narrativeContext`, but Production provides minimal data vs Demo's rich structure.

---

#### Discover Container (JIT-enabled)
**Location:** `/src/components/ai-containers/AIDiscoverContainerV2-JIT.tsx`

**Features:**
- JIT content generation with discovery paths
- Curiosity tracking metrics
- Reflection questions
- Real-time performance analytics

**Similar Gap:** Ready for rich narrative context, but Production doesn't provide it.

---

### 1.5 AI Prompting Strategy

#### PromptBuilder
**Location:** `/src/services/ai-prompts/PromptBuilder.ts`

**Purpose:** Combines hierarchical rules to generate consistent AI prompts

**Rule Hierarchy:**
1. **Universal Content Rules** - Base language constraints
2. **Universal Subject Rules** - Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies
3. **Container-Specific Rules** - Learn, Experience, Discover
4. **Grade-Specific Overrides**
5. **Narrative Context** (NEW - supports MasterNarrative integration)

**Narrative Context Integration:**
```typescript
const narrativeSection = context.narrativeContext ? `
========================================
NARRATIVE CONTEXT - MAINTAIN CONTINUITY
========================================
Setting: ${context.narrativeContext.setting}
Story: ${context.narrativeContext.narrative}
Mission: ${context.narrativeContext.mission}
Career Connection: ${context.narrativeContext.throughLine}
Context: ${context.narrativeContext.context}
Companion: ${context.narrativeContext.companion.name}
Personality: ${context.narrativeContext.companion.personality}
Teaching Style: ${context.narrativeContext.companion.teachingStyle}

CRITICAL: All content must align with this narrative context!
========================================
` : '';
```

**Gap:** PromptBuilder is ready for rich narrative context from Demo, but Production narrative doesn't provide this level of detail.

---

### 1.6 AI Rules Engines

#### Learn Container Rules
**Location:** `/src/services/ai-prompts/rules/LearnContainerRules.ts`

**Defines:**
- Career integration approach
- Tone and feedback style
- Structure requirements (3 examples, 5 practice, 1 assessment)

**Example:**
```typescript
context: {
  career_integration: 'Deep integration - show how professionals use this skill daily',
  focus: 'Skill mastery through guided practice',
  progression: 'Build from recognition → recall → application'
}
```

---

#### Experience Container Rules
**Location:** `/src/services/ai-prompts/rules/ExperienceContainerRules.ts`

**Defines:**
- Hands-on simulation approach
- Project-based learning
- Creative challenges
- Collaboration prompts

**Example:**
```typescript
context: {
  career_integration: 'Hands-on simulation of career tasks',
  focus: 'Learning by doing and creating',
  progression: 'Try → Build → Create'
}
```

---

#### Discover Container Rules
**Location:** `/src/services/ai-prompts/rules/DiscoverContainerRules.ts`

**Defines:**
- Exploration and curiosity building
- Pattern recognition
- "What if" scenarios
- Connection making

**Example:**
```typescript
context: {
  career_integration: 'Exploration - discover how careers use this in surprising ways',
  focus: 'Pattern recognition and curiosity building',
  progression: 'Explore → Question → Connect'
}
```

**Gap Analysis:** Rules engines work with any narrative context quality. Demo provides richer context for rules to work with.

- Quality marker generation
- Personalization example generation

---

## 5. Prompt Strategy Differences

### Demo's Narrative Context (Passed to AI)

```typescript
narrativeContext: {
  setting: "CareerInc Medical Center - Teddy Bear Wing",
  context: "Sam's workplace where teddy bear patients visit",
  narrative: "Sam makes real medical helper decisions",
  mission: "Help teddy bears feel better",
  throughLine: "Sam learns to care for patients at the Teddy Bear Clinic",
  companion: {
    name: "Spark",
    personality: "Energetic and enthusiastic",
    greetingStyle: "Spark bounces excitedly with electric energy",
    encouragementStyle: "provides high-energy motivation",
    teachingStyle: "makes every lesson feel like a fun game",
    celebrationStyle: "explodes with joy and sparkly effects",
    catchphrase: "Learning is AMAZING when we do it together!",
    transitionPhrases: [...]
  },
  subjectContext: {
    math: {
      learn: "Study how doctors use numbers 1-3 for patient rooms",
      experience: "Assign teddy bears to exam rooms 1, 2, 3",
      discover: "See how health fair uses numbered stations"
    },
    // ... for all subjects
  }
}
```

### Production's Narrative Context (Currently Minimal)

```typescript
// What Production currently passes to AI
{
  setting: "CareerInc Medical Center",
  scenario: "helping in a medical environment",
  character: "a Doctor",
  currentChallenge: "applying Counting up to 3 skills",
  careerConnection: "how Doctors use Counting up to 3"
  // Missing: mission, throughLine, companion details, subjectContext
}
```

### Impact on AI Output Quality

**With Demo's Rich Context:**
- AI receives detailed story framework
- Companion personality guides interaction style
- Subject contexts ensure container coherence
- Mission provides purpose throughout
- ThroughLine maintains narrative thread

**With Production's Minimal Context:**
- AI must invent more from scratch
- Less consistency across containers
- Generic companion interactions
- Weaker narrative continuity
- Less immersive overall experience

---

## 6. Rules Engine Differences

### Learn Container Rules (Same for Both)

**Production & Demo Use Same Rules:**
```typescript
{
  career_integration: 'Deep integration - show how professionals use this skill daily',
  focus: 'Skill mastery through guided practice',
  progression: 'Build from recognition → recall → application',
  structure: {
    examples: '3 worked examples',
    practice: '5 scaffolded questions with full practiceSupport',
    assessment: '1 culminating question'
  }
}
```

**Gap:** Rules are identical, but Demo provides richer context FOR the rules to work with.

---

### Experience Container Rules (Same for Both)

**Production & Demo Use Same Rules:**
```typescript
{
  career_integration: 'Hands-on simulation of career tasks',
  focus: 'Learning by doing and creating',
  progression: 'Try → Build → Create',
  special_features: {
    simulations: 'Recreate career scenarios',
    mini_projects: 'Build something using the skill',
    creative_challenges: 'Open-ended problems'
  }
}
```

**Gap:** Same rules, but Demo's enhanced narrative makes simulations more immersive.

---

### Discover Container Rules (Same for Both)

**Production & Demo Use Same Rules:**
```typescript
{
  career_integration: 'Exploration - discover how careers use this in surprising ways',
  focus: 'Pattern recognition and curiosity building',
  progression: 'Explore → Question → Connect',
  structure: {
    examples: '3 career exploration scenarios',
    practice: '2 discovery practice scenarios',
    assessment: '1 challenge scenario'
  }
}
```

**Gap:** Identical rules, but Demo provides more context for exploration.

---

## 7. Architecture Patterns

### Demo Architecture

```
DemonstrativeMasterNarrativeGenerator (extends MasterNarrativeGenerator)
  ↓
generateDemonstrativeNarrative()
  ↓
super.generateMasterNarrative() [Base narrative]
  ↓
Enhancement Pipeline:
  1. enhanceForShowcase() → Add milestones + immersive elements
  2. addParentValue() → Parent value propositions
  3. addQualityGuarantees() → Trust builders + markers
  4. addPersonalizationExamples() → Customization demos
  5. addCompanionInteractions() → Rich dialogue
  ↓
EnhancedMasterNarrative (11 additional layers)
  ↓
Used by: Parent Dashboard, Teacher Dashboard, Admin Dashboard, Marketing
```

**Pattern:** Decorator pattern - enhances base narrative with additional layers

---

### Production Architecture

```
MasterNarrativeGenerator
  ↓
generateMasterNarrative()
  ↓
AI Generation (via MultiModelService)
  OR
Mock Data Fallback
  ↓
MasterNarrative (basic structure only)
  ↓
Passed to:
  → AILearningJourneyService → Container Content
  → JustInTimeContentService → JIT Content
  → Containers → Student Experience
```

**Pattern:** Factory pattern - generates base narrative, consumed by downstream services

**Gap:** No enhancement pipeline, limited context for downstream services

**Estimated Fix Time:** N/A - Not a gap to fix

---

## 9. Technical Debt in Production

### Identified Technical Debt

1. **Minimal Narrative Context**
   - **Debt:** Production creates basic narrative without enhancement pipeline
   - **Impact:** Downstream services (JIT, Containers) receive inadequate context
   - **Fix:** Add enhancement methods to MasterNarrativeGenerator

2. **No Parent-Facing Content**
   - **Debt:** Zero parent value propositions or insights
   - **Impact:** Parents can't understand learning benefits
   - **Fix:** Add parent content generation methods

3. **Missing Immersive Layer**
   - **Debt:** No soundscapes, interactive tools, celebrations
   - **Impact:** Less engaging student experience
   - **Fix:** Add immersive element generation

4. **Weak Companion Integration**
   - **Debt:** Basic companion data, no rich interactions
   - **Impact:** Underutilized companion potential
   - **Fix:** Enhance companion interaction generation

5. **No Quality Indicators**
   - **Debt:** Can't show Common Core alignment, rigor, etc.
   - **Impact:** Reduced trust from educators
   - **Fix:** Add quality marker generation

---

## 10. Retrofit Implementation Plan

### Recommended Approach: **Incremental Retrofit**

**Why Not Big Bang:**
- Lower risk of breaking existing Production
- Can test each enhancement independently
- Easier rollback if issues arise
- Progressive value delivery to customers

**Why Incremental:**
- Demo already extends Production cleanly
- Enhancements are additive, not replacements
- Can enable features via feature flags
- Allows A/B testing of enhancements

---

### Phase 1: Critical Enhancements (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Add parent-facing content and quality markers

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Copy parent value proposition methods from Demo to Production
2. ✅ Copy quality marker generation methods
3. ✅ Copy parent insights generation methods
4. ✅ Add these to MasterNarrative interface
5. ✅ Update mock data generation to include these
6. ✅ Add feature flag: `ENABLE_ENHANCED_NARRATIVE`
7. ✅ Test with existing containers

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// In MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

interface MasterNarrative {
  // Existing fields...

  // NEW: Parent-facing enhancements
  parentValue?: {
    realWorldConnection: string;
    futureReadiness: string;
    engagementPromise: string;
    differentiator: string;
  };

  qualityMarkers?: {
    commonCoreAligned: boolean;
    stateStandardsMet: boolean;
    stemIntegrated: boolean;

private narrativeCache = new Map<string, EnhancedMasterNarrative>();

async generateMasterNarrative(params: MasterNarrativeParams): Promise<MasterNarrative> {
  const cacheKey = this.buildCacheKey(params);

  // Check cache
  if (this.narrativeCache.has(cacheKey)) {
    return this.narrativeCache.get(cacheKey)!;
  }

  // Generate with all enhancements
  let narrative = await this.generateBaseNarrative(params);
  narrative = this.addAllEnhancements(narrative, params);

  // Cache for 30 minutes
  this.narrativeCache.set(cacheKey, narrative);
  setTimeout(() => this.narrativeCache.delete(cacheKey), 30 * 60 * 1000);

  return narrative;
}

// Consolidate enhancement methods
private addAllEnhancements(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  params: MasterNarrativeParams
): MasterNarrative {
  // Apply all enhancement phases in order
  narrative = this.addParentEnhancements(narrative, params);
  narrative = this.addStudentExperienceEnhancements(narrative, params);

- ✅ Cache hit rate > 60%
- ✅ All enhancement layers working in production

---

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Performance Degradation**
- **Mitigation:** Phase-by-phase rollout with performance monitoring
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow instant disable
- **Monitoring:** Track generation time, memory usage, cache hit rates

**Risk 2: Breaking Existing Functionality**
- **Mitigation:** Enhancements are additive (optional fields)
- **Rollback Plan:** Each phase can be independently disabled
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit + integration tests before each phase

**Risk 3: AI Token Cost Increase**
- **Mitigation:** Rich narrative context may reduce AI regeneration needs
- **Monitoring:** Track token usage per session
- **Optimization:** Cache narratives aggressively

#### Business Risks

**Risk 1: User Confusion During Transition**
- **Mitigation:** A/B testing shows improvements before full rollout
- **Communication:** Release notes explaining enhancements
- **Support:** Training for support team on new features

**Risk 2: Delayed Value Delivery**
- **Mitigation:** Incremental phases deliver value progressively
- **Prioritization:** Critical parent-facing features first
- **Quick Wins:** Phase 1 (2 weeks) already delivers major value

---

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing

**Phase 1 Tests:**
```typescript
describe('MasterNarrativeGenerator - Parent Enhancements', () => {
  it('should generate parent value propositions', () => {
    const narrative = generator.generateMasterNarrative(params);
    expect(narrative.parentValue).toBeDefined();
    expect(narrative.parentValue.realWorldConnection).toContain(career.name);
  });

  it('should generate quality markers', () => {
    const narrative = generator.generateMasterNarrative(params);

### Backwards Compatibility Considerations

#### API Compatibility

**Safe Changes (No Breaking):**
- Adding optional fields to MasterNarrative interface
- Adding new methods to MasterNarrativeGenerator
- Enhancing existing narratives with additional data

**Potentially Breaking Changes:**
- None identified (all enhancements are additive)

#### Database Compatibility

**Considerations:**
- Enhanced narratives may be larger (3x size)
- Cache strategy needs update for larger payloads
- No schema changes required (using existing narrative field)

**Migration:**
- No data migration needed
- Existing cached narratives expire naturally
- New narratives generated with enhancements

#### UI Compatibility

**Parent Dashboard:**
- May need UI updates to display new fields
- Graceful degradation if fields missing
- Progressive enhancement approach

**Student Containers:**
- Already designed to handle optional narrative data
- Immersive elements require UI components (may exist already from Demo)
- Milestones need display components

## 11. Code Examples: Demo → Production

### Example 1: Parent Value Propositions

**Demo Implementation (Copy This):**
```typescript
// In DemonstrativeMasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

private addParentValue(
  narrative: EnhancedMasterNarrative,
  params: DemonstrativeNarrativeParams
): EnhancedMasterNarrative {
  const career = narrative.character.role.replace('Junior ', '').replace(' Helper', '');

  return {
    ...narrative,
    parentValue: {
      realWorldConnection: `Your child learns ${params.gradeLevel} skills exactly how real ${career}s use them every day`,
      futureReadiness: `Building tomorrow's innovators through engaging lessons`,
      engagementPromise: `Learning disguised as adventure - they won't want to stop!`,
      differentiator: `Unlike traditional education, every minute connects to a real career, making learning meaningful and memorable`
    }
  };
}
```

**Production Adaptation (Add This):**
```typescript
// In MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

private addParentValue(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  params: MasterNarrativeParams
): MasterNarrative {
  const career = narrative.character.role.replace('Junior ', '').replace(' Helper', '');

  return {
    ...narrative,
    parentValue: {
      realWorldConnection: `Your child learns ${params.gradeLevel} skills exactly how real ${career}s use them every day`,
      futureReadiness: `Building tomorrow's innovators through engaging, career-connected lessons`,
      engagementPromise: `Learning disguised as adventure - they won't want to stop!`,
      differentiator: `Every minute connects to ${params.career}, making learning meaningful and memorable`
    }
  };
}

// Call in generateMasterNarrative():
async generateMasterNarrative(params: MasterNarrativeParams): Promise<MasterNarrative> {
  // ... existing generation ...

  // NEW: Add parent value
  if (process.env.ENABLE_ENHANCED_NARRATIVE === 'true') {
    narrative = this.addParentValue(narrative, params);
  }

  return narrative;
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- Demo uses `DemonstrativeNarrativeParams` (has `showcaseMode`, `sampleCareer`)
- Production uses `MasterNarrativeParams` (standard params)
- Otherwise, implementation is nearly identical

---

### Example 2: Immersive Elements

**Demo Implementation (Copy This):**
```typescript
// In DemonstrativeMasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

private enhanceForShowcase(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  params: DemonstrativeNarrativeParams
): EnhancedMasterNarrative {
  const enhanced: EnhancedMasterNarrative = {
    ...narrative,

    milestones: {
      firstAchievement: `Earn your Junior ${narrative.character.role} Badge`,
      midwayMastery: `Complete your first real ${narrative.character.role.split(' ')[1]} task`,
      finalVictory: `Receive the ${narrative.character.role} Excellence Certificate`,
      bonusChallenge: `Become a Certified ${narrative.character.role} Expert`
    },

    immersiveElements: {
      soundscape: this.getSoundscape(narrative.character.workplace),
      interactiveTools: this.getInteractiveTools(narrative.character.equipment),
      rewardVisuals: [
        'Animated badge ceremony',
        'Virtual trophy collection',
        'Progress constellation map',
        'Achievement gallery'
      ],
      celebrationMoments: [
        'Confetti burst on correct answers',
        'Companion dance celebration',
        'Unlock new career tools',
        'Parent notification of achievement'
      ]
    },

    realWorldApplications: this.generateRealWorldApplications(narrative, params)
  };

  return enhanced;
}

private getSoundscape(workplace: string): string {
  const soundscapes: Record<string, string> = {
    'Medical': 'Gentle hospital sounds, helpful beeps, caring voices',
    'School': 'Happy children learning, bells, playground joy',
    'Kitchen': 'Sizzling pans, chopping sounds, kitchen timer',
    'Laboratory': 'Bubbling experiments, discovery sounds, eureka moments',
    'Studio': 'Creative music, brushstrokes, artistic inspiration'
  };

  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(soundscapes)) {
    if (workplace.includes(key)) return value;
  }
  return 'Engaging ambient sounds that bring the career to life';
}

private getInteractiveTools(equipment: string[]): string[] {
  return equipment.map(tool => `Interactive ${tool} with realistic actions`);
}
```

**Production Adaptation (Add This):**
```typescript
// In MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

private addStudentExperience(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  params: MasterNarrativeParams
): MasterNarrative {
  return {
    ...narrative,

    milestones: {
      firstAchievement: `Earn your Junior ${narrative.character.role} Badge`,
      midwayMastery: `Complete your first real ${narrative.character.role.split(' ')[1]} task`,
      finalVictory: `Receive the ${narrative.character.role} Excellence Certificate`,
      bonusChallenge: `Become a Certified ${narrative.character.role} Expert`
    },

    immersiveElements: {
      soundscape: this.getSoundscape(narrative.character.workplace),
      interactiveTools: this.getInteractiveTools(narrative.character.equipment),
      rewardVisuals: [
        'Animated badge ceremony',
        'Virtual trophy collection',
        'Progress constellation map',
        'Achievement gallery'
      ],
      celebrationMoments: [
        'Confetti burst on correct answers',
        'Companion dance celebration',
        'Unlock new career tools',
        'Parent notification of achievement'
      ]
    },

    realWorldApplications: this.generateRealWorldApplications(narrative, params)
  };
}

// Copy helper methods exactly as-is from Demo
private getSoundscape(workplace: string): string {
  // Copy implementation from Demo
}

private getInteractiveTools(equipment: string[]): string[] {
  // Copy implementation from Demo
}

private generateRealWorldApplications(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  params: MasterNarrativeParams
): Record<string, any> {
  // Copy implementation from Demo
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- Method naming: `enhanceForShowcase()` → `addStudentExperience()`
- Helper methods are identical between Demo and Production

---

### Example 3: Rich Narrative Context for AI

**Demo's Approach (What We Want):**
```typescript
// Demo provides rich context to downstream services

const narrativeContext = {
  setting: narrative.settingProgression.learn.location,
  context: narrative.settingProgression.learn.context,
  narrative: narrative.settingProgression.learn.narrative,
  mission: narrative.cohesiveStory.mission,
  throughLine: narrative.cohesiveStory.throughLine,
  companion: {
    name: narrative.companionIntegration.name,
    personality: narrative.companionIntegration.personality,
    greetingStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.greetingStyle,
    encouragementStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.encouragementStyle,
    teachingStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.teachingStyle,
    celebrationStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.celebrationStyle,
    catchphrase: narrative.companionIntegration.catchphrase,
    transitionPhrases: narrative.companionIntegration.transitionPhrases
  },
  subjectContext: narrative.subjectContextsAligned
};

// This rich context is passed to AILearningJourneyService
```

**Production's Current Approach (What We Have):**
```typescript
// Production provides minimal context

const narrativeContext = {
  setting: this.getCareerSetting(career?.name),
  scenario: `helping in a ${career?.name || 'professional'} environment`,
  character: career ? `a ${career.name}` : 'a professional',
  currentChallenge: `applying ${skill.skill_name} skills`,
  careerConnection: career ? `how ${career.name}s use ${skill.skill_name}` : `using ${skill.skill_name} professionally`
  // Missing: mission, throughLine, companion details, subjectContext
};
```

**Production Fix (Phase 4):**
```typescript
// In MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts

// Add method to build rich narrative context
public getNarrativeContext(
  narrative: MasterNarrative,
  container: 'learn' | 'experience' | 'discover' = 'learn'
): any {
  // Use container-specific settings
  const setting = narrative.settingProgression[container];

  return {
    // Core narrative
    setting: setting.location,
    context: setting.context,
    narrative: setting.narrative,
    mission: narrative.cohesiveStory.mission,
    throughLine: narrative.cohesiveStory.throughLine,

    // Rich companion integration
    companion: {
      name: narrative.companionIntegration.name,
      personality: narrative.companionIntegration.personality,
      greetingStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.greetingStyle,
      encouragementStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.encouragementStyle,
      teachingStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.teachingStyle,
      celebrationStyle: narrative.companionIntegration.celebrationStyle,
      catchphrase: narrative.companionIntegration.catchphrase,
      transitionPhrases: narrative.companionIntegration.transitionPhrases
    },

    // Subject-specific contexts
    subjectContext: narrative.subjectContextsAligned,

    // Enhancement data (if available)
    milestones: narrative.milestones,
    immersiveElements: narrative.immersiveElements
  };
}

// Use in AILearningJourneyService:
const enrichedCareer = {
  name: career?.name || 'Professional',
  description: career?.description,
  narrativeContext: masterNarrative ?
    masterNarrativeGenerator.getNarrativeContext(masterNarrative, 'learn') :
    undefined
};
```

**Impact:**
- AI receives 10x more context
- Better prompt quality
- More consistent narrative across containers
- Richer companion interactions
