## 4. Testing Scenarios

### 4.1 Scenario 1: Full Enrichment (Demo Quality)
**Input**: LessonPlanOrchestrator generates master narrative with all 9 enrichment layers
**Expected**: All enrichment sections appear in prompt
**Verification**: Check console logs for "üéØ Using ENRICHED MasterNarrative context"

### 4.2 Scenario 2: Partial Enrichment
**Input**: Only milestones and companionInteractions provided
**Expected**: Only those two sections appear in prompt
**Verification**: Other enrichment sections completely absent (not shown as "Not provided")

### 4.3 Scenario 3: No Enrichment (Production Fallback)
**Input**: Basic narrative context only (no enrichment fields)
**Expected**: Only basic setting/story section shown
**Verification**: Check console logs for "üéØ Using basic MasterNarrative context"

### 4.4 Scenario 4: No Narrative Context
**Input**: No narrativeContext provided at all
**Expected**: Empty narrative section
**Verification**: Check console logs for "üìñ Created generic context"

## 5. Container-Specific Enrichment Usage

### 5.1 Learn Container
**Priority Fields**:
- ‚úÖ Milestones (motivation)
- ‚úÖ Real-world applications (context)
- ‚úÖ Companion interactions (voice)
- ‚úÖ Personalization examples (tone)

**How Used**:
- Greetings use companionInteractions.greetings
- Concept explanation references realWorldApplications
- Practice questions incorporate personalization tone
- Feedback references milestones

### 5.2 Experience Container
**Priority Fields**:
- ‚úÖ Immersive elements (soundscape, tools)
- ‚úÖ Milestones (career achievements)
- ‚úÖ Real-world applications (scenarios)
- ‚úÖ Companion interactions (hints, celebrations)

**How Used**:
- Scenario setup uses immersiveElements.soundscape
- Character context references milestones as goals
- Challenges connect to realWorldApplications.careerConnection
- Outcomes use companionInteractions.celebrations

### 5.3 Discover Container
**Priority Fields**:
- ‚úÖ Real-world applications (exploration themes)
- ‚úÖ Immersive elements (field trip descriptions)
- ‚úÖ Companion interactions (guidance)
- ‚úÖ Milestones (discovery goals)

**How Used**:
- Exploration theme connects to realWorldApplications
- Curiosity questions reference all time horizons (immediate, near, long-term)
- Discovery paths use immersiveElements as exploration tools
- Activities feature companion as guide using companionInteractions

## 6. Integration Concerns & Issues

### 6.1 ‚úÖ Resolved: Interface Alignment
**Issue**: Ensured JustInTimeContentService and PromptBuilder interfaces match exactly
**Resolution**: Both files now have identical narrativeContext structure

### 6.2 ‚úÖ Resolved: Optional Chaining
**Issue**: System must work with or without enrichment
**Resolution**: All enrichment access uses optional chaining (`?.`)

### 6.3 ‚úÖ Resolved: Subject-Specific Real-World Applications
**Issue**: realWorldApplications is subject-keyed
**Resolution**: Prompt uses `context.narrativeContext.realWorldApplications?.[context.subject]`

### 6.4 ‚úÖ Resolved: Array Field Handling
**Issue**: Some enrichment fields are arrays (greetings[], tools[], etc.)
**Resolution**: Prompt uses `.slice(0, 2).join('; ')` to show samples

### 6.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è Consideration: Prompt Token Length
**Concern**: Enriched prompts are significantly longer
**Impact**: With full enrichment, narrative section adds ~800-1200 tokens
**Mitigation**: AI models support this (GPT-4 has 128k context window)
**Status**: Not an issue, but worth monitoring

### 6.6 ‚ö†Ô∏è Consideration: Parent-Facing Fields
**Concern**: Some enrichment (parentValue, parentInsights, guarantees) not used in student containers
**Impact**: These fields are not injected into prompts (intentional)
**Status**: Working as designed - these are for parent-facing content only
