## Enrichment vs Fallback Content Detection

### How to Identify REAL Enrichment (✅ Good)

**Real Enrichment Indicators**:
1. **Specific Career Integration**
   - ✅ "Chef Alex needs help counting ingredients in the CareerInc Culinary Kitchen"
   - ❌ "Help with math today" (generic)

2. **Detailed Milestones**
   - ✅ "Identified your first number - you're ready to start counting ingredients!"
   - ❌ "Good job on question 1" (generic)

3. **Career-Specific Real-World Apps**
   - ✅ "Chefs use math every day to scale recipes, measure ingredients, and manage kitchen budgets"
   - ❌ "Math is used in many jobs" (generic)

4. **Personalized Parent Value**
   - ✅ "Sam will see exactly how chefs use counting in real kitchens, making math relevant"
   - ❌ "Your child will learn math" (generic)

5. **Quality Markers Present**
   - ✅ "✓ Common Core Aligned, ✓ State Standards Met" with detailed descriptions
   - ❌ No quality markers section (fallback)

### How to Identify Fallback Content (❌ Bad)

**Fallback Content Indicators**:
1. **Generic Career References**
   - ❌ "Today you'll help a professional"
   - ❌ "Learn how workers use this skill"

2. **Missing Enrichment Sections**
   - ❌ PDF has only basic lesson info (no milestone/value/quality sections)
   - ❌ UI shows only subject activities (no enrichment cards)

3. **Placeholder Text**
   - ❌ "Career connection: [To be determined]"
   - ❌ "Real-world application: This skill is important"

4. **No Personalization**
   - ❌ Student name missing from lesson content
   - ❌ "You will learn" instead of "Sam will learn"

5. **Short/Vague Descriptions**
   - ❌ "Use this skill at work"
   - ❌ "Important for future"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Lesson plan shows generic content

**Possible Causes**:
1. LessonPlanOrchestrator not calling `generateEnhancedNarrative()`
2. Enrichment generation failing silently
3. Cache returning old non-enriched content

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools → Console
2. Look for logs: "🎨 Generating ENRICHED Master Narrative (Demo Quality)"
3. If missing, orchestrator is calling old `generateMasterNarrative()`
4. Check LessonPlanOrchestrator.ts line 121

**Fix**:
Ensure orchestrator calls `generateEnhancedNarrative()` instead of `generateMasterNarrative()`

---

### Issue: PDF missing enrichment sections

**Possible Causes**:
1. PDF generator not reading from `content.enrichment.*`
2. Enrichment data not passed to PDF generator
3. Optional chaining preventing display (data actually missing)

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Generate lesson
3. Look for API call returning lesson data
4. Inspect response JSON: does `content.enrichment` exist?
5. If yes → PDF generator issue
6. If no → Orchestrator not passing enrichment

**Fix**:
- If data exists: Check UnifiedLessonPlanPDFGenerator.tsx sections
- If data missing: Check LessonPlanOrchestrator.ts lines 234-245

---

### Issue: Some enrichment fields are null/undefined

**Possible Causes**:
1. Generator method returning incomplete enrichment
2. Career/grade combination missing data
3. AI generation timeout

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check console for errors during generation
2. Verify career name spelling (case-sensitive)
3. Verify grade level format ('K' vs 'Kindergarten')

**Fix**:
Check MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts enrichment methods for the specific career

---

### Issue: Career content doesn't change between students

**Possible Causes**:
1. Cache returning same lesson for all students
2. Career parameter not being passed correctly
3. Generator using hardcoded career

**Debug Steps**:
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Generate lesson for Sam (Chef)
3. Generate lesson for Alex (Doctor)
4. Compare PDF content - should be completely different

**Fix**:
Ensure demo student data includes correct `career_family` field

---
