# Grade-Appropriate Language Implementation Fix

## Problem Identified ✅

The MasterNarrativeGenerator was **not using the established grade-appropriate language rules** from `src/services/ai-prompts/rules/UniversalContentRules.ts`.

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts - Line 476-480
'K': `- Use very simple vocabulary
- Focus on numbers 1-3, uppercase letters, basic shapes, and community
- Short, clear sentences  // ❌ NO SPECIFIC LENGTH CONSTRAINT
- Concrete, visual concepts
- Lots of repetition`
```

### The Missing Rules:
```typescript
// UniversalContentRules.ts - Lines 382-398
LANGUAGE_CONSTRAINTS: {
  K: {
    sentence_length: '3-5 words per sentence',  // ✅ CRITICAL RULE
    vocabulary: 'Simple, common words only',
    instructions: 'One-step directions',
    examples: [
      'The cat is big.',
      'Count the red apples.',
      'Which shape is blue?'
    ],
    avoid: [
      'Complex sentences',
      'Multiple clauses',
      'Abstract concepts',
      'Compound instructions'
    ]
  }
}
```

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Import Language Constraints
```typescript
// MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts - Line 30
import { getLanguageConstraintsOnly } from '../ai-prompts/rules/UniversalContentRules';
```

### 2. Add to AI Prompt
```typescript
// MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts - Lines 452-455
REQUIREMENTS for Grade ${gradeLevel}:
${this.getGradeSpecificRequirements(gradeLevel)}

${getLanguageConstraintsOnly(gradeLevel)}  // ✅ NOW INCLUDES LANGUAGE RULES

IMPORTANT:
- Use age-appropriate language
...
```

## What Changed

The AI prompt now includes **explicit language constraints for each grade level**:

### Kindergarten (K):
- ✅ Sentence Length: **3-5 words per sentence**
- ✅ Vocabulary: Simple, common words only
- ✅ Instructions: One-step directions
- ✅ Examples: "The cat is big.", "Count the red apples."
- ✅ Avoid: Complex sentences, multiple clauses, abstract concepts

### Grade 1-2:
- ✅ Sentence Length: **5-8 words per sentence**
- ✅ Vocabulary: Common words, simple concepts
- ✅ Instructions: Clear, single-step directions

### Grade 3-5:
- ✅ Sentence Length: **8-12 words per sentence**
- ✅ Vocabulary: Grade-appropriate with context clues
- ✅ Instructions: Can include two-step directions

### Grade 6-8:
- ✅ Sentence Length: **10-15 words per sentence**
- ✅ Vocabulary: More complex vocabulary with academic terms
- ✅ Instructions: Multi-step processes with logical sequences

### Grade 9-12:
- ✅ Sentence Length: Varied sentence structure
- ✅ Vocabulary: Advanced vocabulary and technical terms
- ✅ Instructions: Complex, multi-faceted tasks

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Kindergarten Sam (Chef)
**What to Look For:**
```
✅ GOOD (3-5 words):
- "Help chef count apples."
- "Find red shapes."
- "The chef needs help."

❌ BAD (Too long):
- "The chef needs your help counting the ingredients in the kitchen."
- "Can you identify all the red objects that the chef is using?"
```

### Test 2: Grade 1 Alex (Doctor)
**What to Look For:**
```
✅ GOOD (5-8 words):
- "The doctor helps sick people get better."
- "Count the patients in the waiting room."

❌ BAD:
- "Help." (too short for Grade 1)
- "The doctor in the hospital helps many different patients with various medical conditions." (too long)
```

### Test 3: Grade 7 Jordan (Game Designer)
**What to Look For:**
```
✅ GOOD (10-15 words):
- "Game designers use integers to program character movement and score tracking systems."
- "Analyze the game mechanics to determine how player feedback influences design decisions."

❌ BAD:
- "Design games." (too short for Grade 7)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache** (critical - old cached content may remain)
   ```bash
   # Hard refresh in browser
   Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
   Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
   ```

2. **Generate New Lesson**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/test/unified-career`
   - Select: **Sam (K, Chef)**
   - Click: **"Generate Lesson Plan"**

3. **Check Console Logs**
   ```
   Look for: "🎨 Generating ENRICHED Master Narrative (Demo Quality)"
   ```

4. **Inspect Generated Content**
   - Activities should use **3-5 words per sentence** for Kindergarten
   - Mission briefing should be simple: "Help chef count items."
   - NOT complex: "You will assist the chef in counting various ingredients."

5. **Verify PDF Content**
   - Download PDF
   - Check activity descriptions
   - Should see short, simple sentences

## Expected Results

### Kindergarten (Sam, Chef):
- ✅ "Count three apples." (3 words)
- ✅ "Find the big pot." (4 words)
- ✅ "Help chef make soup." (4 words)
- ❌ NOT: "Can you help the chef count all the ingredients we need?" (11 words - too long!)

### Grade 1 (Alex, Doctor):
- ✅ "The doctor checks patient heart rates daily." (7 words)
- ✅ "Help sort medicine by color and size." (7 words)
- ❌ NOT: "Help." (1 word - too short for Grade 1)

### Grade 7 (Jordan, Game Designer):
- ✅ "Game developers use integers to track player scores accurately." (9 words)
- ✅ "Design a scoring system using positive and negative integer values." (10 words)
- ❌ NOT: "Make games." (2 words - too short for Grade 7)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. **MasterNarrativeGenerator.ts**
   - Line 30: Added import for `getLanguageConstraintsOnly`
   - Line 455: Added language constraints to AI prompt

2. **TestUnifiedLessonWithCareerSelector.tsx** (Previous fix)
   - Line 302-305: Now calls real orchestrator instead of cached demo content

### How It Works:
1. When generating a lesson, `LessonPlanOrchestrator` calls `MasterNarrativeGenerator.generateEnhancedNarrative()`
2. MasterNarrativeGenerator builds AI prompt with **grade-specific language constraints**
3. AI generates narrative following the **3-5 words per sentence** rule (for K)
4. Enriched content flows to UI and PDF with grade-appropriate language

### Language Constraint Function:
```typescript
// UniversalContentRules.ts - Lines 443-477
export function getLanguageConstraintsOnly(grade?: string): string {
  const gradeNum = parseInt(grade);
  let constraintKey = '';

  if (grade === 'K' || grade === 'k' || grade === '0') {
    constraintKey = 'K';
  } else if (gradeNum >= 1 && gradeNum <= 2) {
    constraintKey = '1-2';
  }
  // ... etc.

  return `
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADE ${grade}:
  • Sentence Length: ${constraints.sentence_length}
  • Vocabulary: ${constraints.vocabulary}
  • Instructions: ${constraints.instructions}

  Good Examples:
    "${examples[0]}"
    "${examples[1]}"
  `;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test with Sam (K, Chef)** - Verify 3-5 word sentences
2. ✅ **Test with Alex (1, Doctor)** - Verify 5-8 word sentences
3. ✅ **Test with Jordan (7, Game Designer)** - Verify 10-15 word sentences
4. ✅ **Test with Taylor (10, Sports Agent)** - Verify varied structure

## Impact

**Before:** AI could generate complex sentences for Kindergarten:
- ❌ "The chef needs your help counting all the ingredients in the kitchen today."

**After:** AI follows strict 3-5 word constraint:
- ✅ "Help chef count items." (4 words)
- ✅ "Count three big apples." (4 words)
- ✅ "Find red shapes here." (4 words)

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - MasterNarrativeGenerator now uses established grade-appropriate language rules
**Testing:** Ready for validation with all 4 demo users
**Documentation:** Updated in this file
