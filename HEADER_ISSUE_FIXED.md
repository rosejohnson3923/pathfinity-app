# Header Issue Fixed - MultiSubjectContainer

## Problem Identified
The issue shown in Issue.pdf page 5 was that the header in the MultiSubjectContainer completion screen was only showing subject tabs (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies) without displaying the career and skill information.

## Root Cause
The progressHeader in `MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` was only rendering subject tabs without including the career and skill context that should be displayed to the user.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx
Added a header title section that displays:
- Career being explored
- Current skill being learned

```jsx
<div className={styles.headerTitle}>
  <h2>
    Exploring {selectedCareer?.name || 'Career'} through {getCurrentSkill?.skill_name || getCurrentSkill?.name || 'Learning'}
  </h2>
</div>
```

### 2. Added CSS Styles
Updated `MultiSubjectContainer.module.css` with:
- `.headerTitle` class for proper styling
- Centered text alignment
- Appropriate font sizing and weight

### 3. Fixed Skill Name Display
Also fixed the completion message in `AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` to properly use `skill?.skill_name` with fallbacks.

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/ai-containers/MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` (lines 362-389)
2. `/src/styles/containers/MultiSubjectContainer.module.css` (lines 54-81)
3. `/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` (line 1244)

## Expected Result
The header should now display:
- **Title**: "Exploring [Career] through [Skill Name]" (e.g., "Exploring Doctor through Identify numbers - up to 3")
- **Subject Tabs**: Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies (with active subject highlighted)

## Testing
1. Navigate through the learning containers
2. Complete a lesson to reach the completion screen
3. Verify the header shows both:
   - Career and skill information in the title
   - Subject progress tabs below

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The header now properly displays career and skill information along with subject tabs.
