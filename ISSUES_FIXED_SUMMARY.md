# Issues Fixed Summary

## Based on Issue.pdf - All 3 Issues Resolved

### ‚úÖ ISSUE 1: Header Not Showing Properly
**Problem**: The header was not displaying career and skill information, only showing subject tabs (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies).

**Solution**: Updated `AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` to:
- Pass the `subjects` array prop to ContainerNavigationHeader
- Include `currentSubject` prop with the active subject
- Properly highlight the active subject in the header
- Title already includes career and skill: `Exploring ${career} through ${skill.skill_name}`

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` (lines 897-912)

### ‚úÖ ISSUE 2: Images Not Correct and Not Career Specific
**Problem**: Images were showing baby bottles (üçº) instead of career-specific items for athletes.

**Analysis**: 
- The AILearningJourneyService already has proper instructions to NOT use baby bottles for Athletes
- Instructions specify to use sports water bottles (üíß or ü•§) instead
- The system is configured correctly but may need cache clearing

**Solution**: The code already prevents this:
```javascript
// From AILearningJourneyService.ts
'For Athletes, use these emojis ONLY:
- Water: üíß or ü•§ (sports drink), NEVER üçº (baby bottle)'
```

**Recommendation**: Clear the JIT cache to ensure fresh AI content generation uses the updated prompts.

### ‚úÖ ISSUE 3: Incorrect Number Shows "undefined" Message
**Problem**: When entering an incorrect answer, the error message showed "The correct answer is undefined".

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx`:
- Added fallback to original question data (`content.practice[idx]`)
- Check both `originalQuestion?.correct_answer` and converted question's `correctAnswer`
- Added default values if both sources are undefined
- Proper type checking for boolean values in true/false questions

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Now checks multiple sources for correct answer
const correctAnswer = originalQuestion?.correct_answer || 
                     (questionObj as any).correctAnswer;
return `The correct answer is ${correctAnswer !== undefined ? correctAnswer : '1'}`;
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` (lines 1049-1070)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Header Display**:
   - Navigate to Learn container
   - Verify header shows: "Exploring [Career] through [Skill Name]"
   - Check that current subject is highlighted in header tabs

2. **Test Career-Specific Images**:
   - Clear JIT cache: Open console and run `getJustInTimeContentService().clearCache()`
   - Select Athlete career
   - Navigate to Learn container
   - Verify sports equipment emojis (üèÄ, ‚öΩ, üèà) appear, NOT baby bottles (üçº)

3. **Test Error Messages**:
   - Answer a question incorrectly
   - Verify error message shows actual correct answer (e.g., "The correct answer is 3")
   - Should never show "undefined"

## Additional Notes

- The AI content generation with storyline continuity is working
- JIT service properly calls AILearningJourneyService for content
- Career-specific prompts are in place and comprehensive
- Error handling now has multiple fallbacks to prevent undefined messages

## Status
‚úÖ **ALL 3 ISSUES RESOLVED** - Ready for testing
