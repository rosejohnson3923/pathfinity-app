## 📈 Progress Summary

### What's Done:
- **Backend**: 90% complete (missing some real-time features)
- **Database**: 100% complete
- **AI Integration**: 100% complete
- **Content**: 100% complete for 5 industries
- **Services**: 80% complete (missing some game features)

### What's Needed:
- **Frontend UI**: 20% complete (mostly missing)
- **Multiplayer UI**: 10% complete (logic exists, UI missing)
- **Polish**: 5% complete (no animations, sounds, effects)
- **Testing**: 30% complete (backend tested, frontend not)

### Overall Completion: ~45%

The foundation is solid with excellent backend infrastructure and AI content generation. The main gap is the user interface - we need to build the actual game screens that players will interact with. The good news is that all the hard backend work is done, and creating the UI should be straightforward with the existing services.
