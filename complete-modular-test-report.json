        "explanation": "To evaluate the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity, divide each term in the numerator and denominator by x^2, the highest power of x in the denominator. This simplifies the function to f(x) = (3 - 2/x + 1/x^2) / (1 + 1/x + 1/x^2). As x approaches infinity, the terms involving 1/x and 1/x^2 approach 0, leaving f(x) ‚âà 3/1 = 3. This indicates that the model's performance stabilizes at a constant rate as the dataset size becomes very large."
