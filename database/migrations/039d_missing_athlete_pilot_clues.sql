-- VERIFICATION QUERY
-- ================================================================
-- Run this to verify all 24 careers now have clues:

-- SELECT career_code, COUNT(*) as clue_count
-- FROM dl_clues
-- WHERE grade_category = 'elementary' AND is_active = true
-- GROUP BY career_code
-- ORDER BY career_code;

-- Expected result: 24 careers Ã— 5 clues each = 120 total clues
