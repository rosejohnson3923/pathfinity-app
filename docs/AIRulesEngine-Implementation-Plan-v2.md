# AIRulesEngine Implementation Plan v2.0
## Comprehensive Refactoring with Theme, AICompanions, and Gamification

### Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring strategy to address systemic technical debt in the Pathfinity codebase by implementing a centralized AIRulesEngine architecture. The refactoring addresses scattered business rules, eliminates recurring bugs, and establishes a maintainable foundation for future development.

### Critical Updates in v2.0
- **AICompanions Correction**: Four persistent companions (Finn, Spark, Harmony, Sage) that evolve with students
- **Career Context Integration**: All companions adapt content based on chosen career path
- **Toast Notifications**: Career-specific messaging through companion personalities
- **Chatbot Services**: Career-contextualized responses for learning support

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Rules Engines

```typescript
AIRulesEngine/
├── MasterAIRulesEngine           // Orchestrator for all rules
├── Container Rules/
│   ├── LearnAIRulesEngine        // Learning journey rules
│   ├── ExperienceAIRulesEngine   // Engagement & interaction
│   └── DiscoverAIRulesEngine     // Exploration & assessment
├── UIAIRulesEngine               // UI-content mapping rules
├── ThemeRulesEngine              // Light/Dark theme rules
├── CompanionRulesEngine          // Finn, Spark, Harmony, Sage rules
└── GamificationRulesEngine       // Progression & rewards

```

```

## 2. CompanionRulesEngine (Corrected)

### 2.1 Core Companions
The system includes four persistent AI companions that support students throughout their journey:

```typescript
enum CompanionId {
  FINN = 'finn',      // The Friendly Guide
  SPARK = 'spark',    // The Creative Innovator
  HARMONY = 'harmony', // The Supportive Friend
  SAGE = 'sage'       // The Wise Mentor
}
```

### 2.2 Career-Contextualized Interactions

#### Toast Notifications by Career
```typescript
interface CareerToastTemplates {
  Doctor: {
    welcome: ["Time for your learning checkup!", "The doctor will see you now... for learning!"],
    progress: ["Your learning vital signs look great!", "Treatment plan working perfectly!"],
    achievement: ["Diagnosis: You're a learning expert!", "Medical degree in {subject} earned!"]
  },
  Teacher: {
    welcome: ["Welcome to today's lesson!", "Class is in session!"],
    progress: ["You're making the grade!", "Excellent classroom participation!"],
    achievement: ["Honor roll achievement!", "Top of the class!"]
  },
  Athlete: {
    welcome: ["Time to train your brain!", "Ready for mental gymnastics?"],
    progress: ["You're in the lead!", "Personal best in progress!"],
    achievement: ["Gold medal performance!", "Championship won!"]
  }
  // ... 12 more careers
}
```

#### Chatbot Responses by Career
```typescript
interface CareerChatbotTemplates {
  Doctor: {
    greeting: ["Hello, future doctor! How can I help you heal your learning today?"],
    helpOffered: ["Let me prescribe the perfect learning solution!"],
    conceptExplanation: ["Think of it like how a doctor examines symptoms..."],
    problemSolving: ["Let's examine this problem like a medical case!"],
    celebration: ["Excellent diagnosis, Doctor!"]
  },
  // ... for all 15 careers
}
```

### 2.3 Companion Evolution by Grade

```typescript
interface GradeEvolution {
  'K-2': {
    vocabularyLevel: 'basic',
    supportLevel: 'high',
    visualComplexity: 'simple',
    careerMetaphors: 'concrete'
  },
  '3-5': {
    vocabularyLevel: 'intermediate',
    supportLevel: 'medium',
    visualComplexity: 'moderate',
    careerMetaphors: 'mixed'
  },
  '6-8': {
    vocabularyLevel: 'advanced',
    supportLevel: 'low',
    visualComplexity: 'detailed',
    careerMetaphors: 'abstract'
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Integration Points

```typescript
class CompanionRulesEngine {
  // Core methods
  getCareerMessage(companion: CompanionId, career: Career, type: 'toast' | 'chatbot'): string
  adaptToGradeLevel(companion: CompanionId, grade: string): CompanionAdaptation
  generateToastNotification(context: CompanionContext): ToastMessage
  generateChatbotResponse(context: CompanionContext): ChatbotResponse
  
  // Career-specific content generation
  applyCareerContext(content: any, career: Career): any
  getCareerVocabulary(career: Career): string[]
  getCareerMetaphors(career: Career, gradeLevel: string): string[]
}
```

---

## 3. ThemeRulesEngine (Enhanced)

### 3.1 Theme-Aware Data Requests

```typescript
interface ThemeDataRules {
  lightTheme: {
    apiEndpoints: {
      images: 'light-optimized',
      colors: 'high-contrast-light'
    },
    dataFilters: {
      brightness: 'enhanced',
      saturation: 'moderate'
    }
  },
  darkTheme: {
    apiEndpoints: {
      images: 'dark-optimized',
      colors: 'high-contrast-dark'
    },
    dataFilters: {
      brightness: 'reduced',
      saturation: 'muted'
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Component-Specific Theme Rules

```typescript
interface ComponentThemeRules {
  VisualRenderer: {
    light: { background: '#F9FAFB', border: '#D1D5DB', shadow: 'soft' },
    dark: { background: '#2D3748', border: '#4B5563', shadow: 'glow' }
  },
  AICompanionChat: {
    light: { bubbleColor: '#E5E7EB', textColor: '#111827' },
    dark: { bubbleColor: '#374151', textColor: '#F3F4F6' }
  },
  // ... for all components
}
```

---

## 4. GamificationRulesEngine (Complete)

### 4.1 Progression Rules

```typescript
interface ProgressionRules {
  points: {
    correctAnswer: 10,
    firstTry: 5,
    streak: 2,
    careerBonus: 3
  },
  levels: {
    calculation: 'logarithmic',
    thresholds: [0, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
  },
  badges: {
    types: ['skill', 'career', 'streak', 'exploration'],
    unlockRules: Map<BadgeType, UnlockCondition>
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Career-Specific Achievements

```typescript
interface CareerAchievements {
  Doctor: {
    badges: ['First Aid Expert', 'Diagnosis Master', 'Healing Hero'],
    milestones: ['10 health problems solved', '100 patients helped']
  },
  Athlete: {
    badges: ['Training Champion', 'Team Player', 'Gold Medalist'],
    milestones: ['10 day streak', '100 exercises completed']
  }
  // ... for all careers
}
```

## 7. Migration Strategy

### 7.1 Existing Code Refactoring

```typescript
// BEFORE: Scattered companion logic
if (companion === 'finn') {
  message = "Great job!";
} else if (companion === 'spark') {
  message = "Brilliant!";
}

// AFTER: Centralized rules engine
const message = companionRulesEngine.getCareerMessage(
  companion,
  student.career,
  'toast',
  'achievement'
);
```

### 7.2 Service Integration

```typescript
// Toast Notification Service
class ToastNotificationService {
  constructor(private companionRules: CompanionRulesEngine) {}
  
  showNotification(type: string, context: any) {
    const notification = this.companionRules.generateToastNotification({
      companion: context.companion,
      career: context.career,
      messageIntent: type,
      student: context.student
    });
    
    this.display(notification);
  }
}

// Chatbot Service
class ChatbotService {
  constructor(private companionRules: CompanionRulesEngine) {}
  
  getResponse(message: string, context: any) {
    return this.companionRules.generateChatbotResponse({
      companion: context.companion,
      career: context.career,
      messageIntent: this.detectIntent(message),
      student: context.student
    });
  }
}
```
