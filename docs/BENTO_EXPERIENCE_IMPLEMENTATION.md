## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
1. **Free-flowing particles** instead of connected networks for visual effects
2. **Age-appropriate complexity** increases gradually
3. **Career integration** at all levels, not just high school
4. **Visual feedback** is immediate and encouraging

### Technical Decisions
1. **Canvas-based** for smooth animations and interactions
2. **Component-based activities** for reusability
3. **TypeScript** for type safety
4. **CSS Modules** for scoped styling

### Accessibility Considerations
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader descriptions for visual elements
- High contrast mode support
- Adjustable animation speeds
