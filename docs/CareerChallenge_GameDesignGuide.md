# Career Challenge: Crisis Commander - Comprehensive Design & Implementation Guide

## Game Overview
**Career Challenge: Crisis Commander** is an educational multiplayer game where players assume the role of CEOs managing corporate crises. Through strategic decision-making, players learn real-world business leadership skills while competing against peers in industry-themed rooms.

## Core Game Concept

### The Premise
- **You are the CEO** of a company facing a crisis
- **Choose your Crisis Commander** (C-Suite executive) to delegate crisis management
- **Select solutions** from a pool of perfect and imperfect options
- **Learn through the lens effect** - your C-Suite choice biases your perception
- **Develop the 6 C's of Leadership** through gameplay and reflection

### Educational Objectives
1. Understand how different departments view the same crisis differently
2. Learn to identify and compensate for cognitive biases
3. Develop cross-functional thinking skills
4. Practice crisis management decision-making
5. Build the 6 C's of Leadership competencies

## Game Flow Architecture

### Pre-Game Setup
1. **Room Selection**
   - Players join Pathfinity-managed themed rooms
   - Each room represents a fictional company (TechCorp, RetailMax, HealthFirst, etc.)
   - Room capacity: 3-8 players
   - No team formation - all players compete individually as CEOs

2. **Player Onboarding**
   - Brief tutorial on game mechanics
   - Introduction to the 6 C's of Leadership
   - Practice round with simplified crisis

### Game Round Structure

#### Phase 1: Crisis Alert (10 seconds)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CRISIS AT TECHCORP!         │
│                                     │
│        🦠 FLU OUTBREAK 🦠          │
│                                     │
│   Multiple employees infected.      │
│   Office temporarily closed.        │
│   Media attention growing.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Player Experience:**
- Crisis card reveals simultaneously to all players
- Timer countdown visible
- Dramatic sound effect and visual alert
- No solutions visible yet

#### Phase 2: C-Suite Selection (20 seconds)
```
Who will you delegate this crisis to?

┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│   CMO    │ │   COO    │ │   CFO    │ │   CTO    │ │   CHRO   │
├──────────┤ ├──────────┤ ├──────────┤ ├──────────┤ ├──────────┤
│"This is │ │"We must  │ │"Protect  │ │"Tech can │ │"People   │
│ a PR     │ │maintain  │ │ the      │ │ solve    │ │ come     │
│ crisis!" │ │operations"│ │ bottom   │ │ this"    │ │ first"   │
└──────────┘ └──────────┘ │ line"    │ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
                          └──────────┘
```

**Key Mechanics:**
- Each C-Suite executive presents their interpretation
- Player must choose ONE executive
- Choice is LOCKED before solutions are revealed
- This choice determines:
  - The lens through which solutions are evaluated
  - The team member pool available later

#### Phase 3: Solution Selection (45 seconds)
```
Your CMO Lens Active 📢
Select 5 solutions from the available options:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Media Blitz Campaign                  │
│    ⭐⭐⭐ PR Impact | 📰 High Visibility │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Enhanced Sick Leave Benefits          │
│    ⭐ PR Impact | 💭 "Expected baseline" │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Contact Tracing System                │
│    ⭐⭐ PR Impact | 🔬 "Too technical"   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Clear Employee Communication          │
│    ⭐⭐⭐ PR Impact | 📢 "Message control"│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [... 6 more solutions ...]               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Selected: [2/5]  Time: 00:32
```

**The Lens System:**
- Solutions appear with lens-specific ratings and descriptions
- Perfect solutions may look weak through wrong lens
- Imperfect solutions may look attractive through wrong lens
- Players select exactly 5 solutions
- Real-time feedback shows selection count

#### Phase 4: Solution Lock & Reveal (20 seconds)
```

## Detailed Game Mechanics

### The Lens Effect System

#### How Lenses Work
Each C-Suite selection creates a cognitive filter that affects how solutions are presented:

**CMO Lens:**
- Emphasizes: PR impact, brand value, media attention
- De-emphasizes: Operational details, employee welfare, technical solutions
- Trap cards: Media campaigns, reputation management, spin control

**CHRO Lens:**
- Emphasizes: Employee wellbeing, morale, retention
- De-emphasizes: Financial impact, technical solutions, external PR
- Trap cards: Excessive benefits, feel-good initiatives without substance

**CFO Lens:**
- Emphasizes: Cost, ROI, financial risk, liability
- De-emphasizes: Human factors, long-term brand, employee trust
- Trap cards: Cost-cutting measures, liability waivers, productivity tracking

**COO Lens:**
- Emphasizes: Business continuity, efficiency, process
- De-emphasizes: Human factors, PR, innovation
- Trap cards: Rigid timelines, premature return-to-normal, over-systematization

**CTO Lens:**
- Emphasizes: Technical solutions, digital transformation, automation
- De-emphasizes: Human needs, simple solutions, change management
- Trap cards: Over-engineered solutions, untested platforms, tech-first thinking

### Solution Card Categories

#### Perfect Solutions (Crisis-Appropriate)
These are the objectively best responses for the given crisis:
- Address root cause
- Balance stakeholder needs
- Follow industry best practices
- Demonstrate all 6 C's of Leadership

#### Imperfect Solutions (Lens Traps)
These appear attractive through specific lenses but are suboptimal:
- **CMO Traps:** PR over substance
- **CFO Traps:** Cost over people
- **CTO Traps:** Technology over practicality
- **COO Traps:** Process over flexibility
- **CHRO Traps:** Feelings over effectiveness

### Scoring System

#### Base Scoring
- Perfect solution selected: +100 points
- Imperfect solution selected: -20 points
- Perfect solution missed: -30 points (opportunity cost)

#### Multipliers
- Correct C-Suite for crisis type: 1.5x multiplier
- Neutral C-Suite choice: 1.0x multiplier
- Opposing C-Suite choice: 0.75x multiplier

#### Speed Bonuses
- First to lock in: +20% bonus
- Second to lock in: +10% bonus
- Last to lock in: No bonus

#### Leadership C's Scoring
Each C is rated 1-5 stars based on solution choices:
- 5 stars in any C: +50 bonus points
- Average 4+ stars across all C's: +100 bonus points
- Any C at 1 star: -25 points

### Crisis Types and Optimal Lenses

| Crisis Type | Optimal Lens | Why | Trap Lenses |
|------------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| Health/Safety Crisis | CHRO | People-first approach critical | CFO (costs), CMO (optics) |
| Data Breach | CTO | Technical expertise needed | CMO (cover-up), COO (quick fix) |
| Supply Chain | COO | Operational focus required | CFO (cost only), CTO (over-engineer) |
| PR Scandal | CMO | Brand expertise crucial | CHRO (internal only), CFO (ignore) |
| Financial Crisis | CFO | Financial acumen needed | CHRO (overspend), CMO (appearances) |
| Product Defect | COO/CMO | Operations + Brand | CFO (cheap fix), CTO (blame tech) |

### Game Engine Logic

#### Phase Transitions
```typescript
class CrisisCommanderEngine {
  async startRound(crisis: Crisis) {
    // Phase 1: Alert
    await this.broadcastPhase('alert', { crisis });
    await this.wait(10000);

    // Phase 2: C-Suite Selection
    await this.broadcastPhase('csuit');
    await this.waitForAllPlayers(20000);

    // Phase 3: Solution Selection
    await this.broadcastPhase('solution');
    await this.waitForAllPlayers(45000);

    // Phase 4: Reveal
    await this.calculateScores();
    await this.broadcastPhase('reveal');
    await this.wait(20000);

    // Phase 5: Leadership Analysis
    await this.generateLeadershipReports();
    await this.broadcastPhase('analysis');
    await this.wait(30000);

    // Check for next round
    if (this.hasMoreRounds()) {
      await this.startRound(this.getNextCrisis());
    } else {
      await this.endGame();
    }
  }
}
```

#### Lens Application Algorithm
```typescript
function applyLens(
  solution: Solution,
  executive: CSuiteRole
): LensedSolution {
  const lensEffect = solution.lensRatings.get(executive);

  return {
    ...solution,
    displayValue: lensEffect.stars,
    displayDescription: lensEffect.description,
    visualEmphasis: lensEffect.emphasis,
    // Hide true nature if lens distorts
    isPerfectHidden: lensEffect.distorts
  };
}
```

#### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
function calculateScore(
  selections: Solution[],
  executive: CSuiteRole,
  crisis: Crisis,
  completionTime: number
): ScoreResult {
  let baseScore = 0;
  let perfectCount = 0;

  // Calculate base score
  selections.forEach(solution => {
    if (solution.isPerfect) {
      baseScore += 100;
      perfectCount++;
    } else {
      baseScore -= 20;
    }
  });

  // Add opportunity cost
  const missedPerfect = crisis.perfectSolutions.length - perfectCount;
  baseScore -= missedPerfect * 30;

  // Apply lens multiplier
  const lensMultiplier = getLensMultiplier(executive, crisis.optimalExecutive);
  const adjustedScore = baseScore * lensMultiplier;

  // Add speed bonus
  const speedBonus = getSpeedBonus(completionTime);
  const finalScore = adjustedScore * (1 + speedBonus);

  return {
    baseScore,
    lensMultiplier,
    speedBonus,
    finalScore,
    perfectCount
  };
}
```

#### 6 C's Analysis Engine
```typescript
function analyzeLeadership(
  selections: Solution[],
  executive: CSuiteRole,
  timing: number
): LeadershipReport {
  const ratings: SixCs = {
    character: 0,
    competence: 0,
    communication: 0,
    compassion: 0,
    commitment: 0,
    confidence: 0
  };

  // Analyze each solution's impact
  selections.forEach(solution => {
    Object.entries(solution.leadershipImpacts).forEach(([c, impact]) => {
      ratings[c] += impact;
    });
  });

  // Normalize to 5-star scale
  Object.keys(ratings).forEach(c => {
    ratings[c] = Math.max(1, Math.min(5, ratings[c]));
  });

  // Add timing impacts
  if (timing < 15000) ratings.confidence += 1;
  if (timing > 40000) ratings.confidence -= 1;

  return {
    ratings,
    insights: generateInsights(ratings),
    realWorldExample: getRealWorldExample(ratings),
    careerRecommendations: getCareerPaths(ratings)
  };
}
```
