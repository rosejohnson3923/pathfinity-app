Time Pressure (2x):   100 Arcade XP per match (last 60s)
```

### XP Conversion
**10 Arcade XP = 1 PathIQ XP**

### Example Game Earnings
```
Winner (5 matches, perfect memory):
- 5 matches √ó 50 XP = 250 XP
- 1st place bonus = 200 XP
- Perfect memory = 500 XP

## üîß Technical Architecture

### State Management

- Local state for UI animations
- Server as source of truth

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading card images
- Staggered animations to prevent jank
- Debounced card clicks (300ms)
- Indexed database queries
- Memoized callbacks

### Error Handling
- Try-catch in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms
- Graceful fallbacks (image placeholders)
- Network error recovery

---

## üìù Notes

### AI Player Implementation
The AI players use a memory simulation system where they "remember" revealed cards based on difficulty:
- Easy AI forgets 70% of cards
- Medium AI forgets 40% of cards
- Hard AI forgets only 10% of cards

This creates realistic gameplay where AI players make strategic moves based on their memory, providing appropriate challenge levels for different age groups.

### Sound Design Philosophy
All sounds are integrated through MasterSoundSystem to ensure:
1. Consistent volume levels across the game
2. No overlapping/conflicting sounds
3. Seamless background music looping
4. Proper audio cleanup on unmount

### Realtime Strategy
The game uses a hybrid approach:
- Database as source of truth (prevents cheating)
- Realtime broadcasts for immediate feedback
- Optimistic UI updates for smooth UX
- Automatic state reconciliation on events
