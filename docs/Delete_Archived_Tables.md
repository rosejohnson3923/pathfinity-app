# Delete Archived Supabase Tables

## Overview

Now that all three Discovered Live games are successfully decoupled and working with their own dedicated table namespaces, we can safely delete the archived tables that were created during the migration process.

---

## Background: Game Decoupling

Previously, all three games shared the same database tables:
- **Career Bingo** used `dl_*` tables ("Discovered Live")
- **CEO Takeover** and **The Decision Desk** shared `cc_*` tables ("Career Challenge")

This caused conflicts and made it difficult to evolve each game independently.

### Migration Process (Completed)

1. **Migration 046** - Created new `cb_*` tables for Career Bingo
2. **Migration 047** - Renamed `dl_*` → `_archived_dl_*` (Career Bingo old tables)
3. **Migration 051** - Copied `cc_*` → `dd_*` for The Decision Desk
4. **Migration 052** - Renamed `cc_*` → `_archived_cc_*` (Decision Desk old tables)

### Current State ✅

All games now use dedicated table namespaces:
- ✅ **Career Bingo** → `cb_*` tables
- ✅ **CEO Takeover** → `ccm_*` tables
- ✅ **The Decision Desk** → `dd_*` tables

## Why It's Safe to Delete

### 1. All Games Verified Working ✅

- ✅ Career Bingo sound working (confirmed)
- ✅ CEO Takeover sound working (just integrated)
- ✅ The Decision Desk sound working (confirmed)

### 2. Code Migration Complete ✅

All application code has been updated to use new tables:
- **Career Bingo** → Uses `CareerChallengeService.ts` with `cb_*` tables
- **CEO Takeover** → Uses `CCMService.ts` with `ccm_*` tables
- **The Decision Desk** → Uses `CompanyRoomService.ts` with `dd_*` tables

### 3. No Dependencies ✅

The archived tables were renamed specifically to **break dependencies**. If any code still referenced them, it would have failed immediately, alerting us to fix it.

Since all games are working, no code references the archived tables.

### 4. Data Preserved ✅

All data was **copied** (not moved) during migration:
- `dl_*` data was copied to `cb_*` tables
- `cc_*` data was copied to `dd_*` tables

The new tables contain all the data from the old tables.

## Migration Script

**File:** `/database/migrations/056_drop_archived_tables.sql`

This migration will:
1. ✅ List all archived tables before deletion
2. ✅ Drop all `_archived_dl_*` tables (Career Bingo)
3. ✅ Drop all `_archived_cc_*` tables (Decision Desk)
4. ✅ Verify deletion was successful
5. ✅ Report any remaining archived tables

---

## How to Run

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `/database/migrations/056_drop_archived_tables.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**

### Option 2: Via psql (Command Line)

```bash
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f database/migrations/056_drop_archived_tables.sql
```

### Option 3: Via API Server (If supported)

If your API server has migration support:

```bash
cd api-server
npm run migrate:up
```

## Rollback (Emergency Only)

If you need to restore archived tables, you can restore from Supabase backup:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Database** → **Backups**
2. Select a backup from before running this migration
3. Restore specific tables (not full database)

**Note:** Since all games are working with new tables, rollback should not be necessary.

---

## Database Space Freed

Deleting 32 archived tables will free up significant database space:
- Reduced storage costs
- Faster database operations
- Cleaner schema

**Estimated space savings:** Varies based on data, but typically 20-40% reduction in total table count.
