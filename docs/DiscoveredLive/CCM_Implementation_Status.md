## ⚠️ Blockers & Risks

### Content Creation
**Risk:** Writing quality challenge scenarios takes time
**Mitigation:** Start with 5 simple scenarios, expand later

### Real-Time Complexity
**Risk:** WebSocket sync can be tricky with multiple players
**Mitigation:** Follow Career Bingo pattern (already proven)

### AI Player Logic
**Risk:** AI must make believable decisions
**Mitigation:** Service already built, just needs tuning
