# Discovered Live! Arcade - Modular Architecture Design

## üéØ Executive Summary

We've designed a **mechanic-based arcade system** that allows you to build multiple educational games using shared infrastructure. Instead of creating separate systems for each game, we have:

- **4 reusable game engines** (Bingo, Resource Management, Decision Tree, Scenario Roleplay)
- **Unified database schema** with flexible JSONB columns
- **Shared service layer** for XP, achievements, and leaderboards
- **Content reusability** across game types

---

## üéÆ Priority Game Types

### 1. **BINGO** - Pattern Recognition & Matching
**Example**: Career Detective Bingo, Math Bingo, Vocabulary Bingo
- **Mechanic**: Match clues to subjects on a 5√ó5 grid
- **Win Condition**: Complete rows, columns, or diagonals
- **Educational Value**: Quick recall, pattern recognition, subject mastery

### 2. **RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT** - Strategic Decision-Making
**Example**: Career Budget Challenge, Business Manager, Time Allocator
- **Mechanic**: Manage limited resources (time, money, energy) across multiple rounds
- **Win Condition**: Maintain resources above threshold while maximizing reputation
- **Educational Value**: Trade-offs, prioritization, real-world decision-making

### 3. **DECISION_TREE** - Critical Thinking & Consequences
**Example**: Career Path Explorer, Life Choices, Industry Navigator
- **Mechanic**: Branching narrative where choices affect future options
- **Win Condition**: Navigate to a successful career outcome
- **Educational Value**: Cause-and-effect, long-term thinking, exploring possibilities

### 4. **SCENARIO_ROLEPLAY** - Immersive Career Experience
**Example**: Day in the Life, Crisis Response, Professional Simulator
- **Mechanic**: Handle realistic career challenges in sequence
- **Win Condition**: Maintain high performance scores across all metrics
- **Educational Value**: Applied skills, professional judgment, situational awareness

## üìä Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables

```
game_mechanic_types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Defines base mechanics (how games work)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Stores scoring rules and configuration schemas

arcade_games
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Specific game instances (mechanic + content theme)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Links: game_mechanic_types
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Example: "Career Bingo" = bingo mechanic + career content

game_content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Universal content pool for ALL games
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Flexible content_data JSONB (different per content_type)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reusable across multiple games

game_sessions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tracks individual gameplay sessions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Links: arcade_games, game_mechanic_types
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Flexible game_state JSONB (different per mechanic)

game_interactions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Records player actions and responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Links: game_sessions, game_content
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Flexible interaction_data JSONB (different per mechanic)

game_leaderboards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cross-game rankings and statistics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Can rank by game, mechanic, or all games combined
```

### Key Design Decisions

**‚úÖ Why JSONB?**
- Each game type has unique state (bingo grid vs. resource pools vs. decision paths)
- Avoids creating 20+ tables as we add more games
- Maintains type safety through TypeScript interfaces
- Easy to evolve game mechanics without schema migrations

**‚úÖ Why separate game_mechanic_types and arcade_games?**
- **Mechanic** = HOW you play (bingo pattern matching)
- **Game** = WHAT you play (careers vs. math vs. vocabulary)
- Example: One bingo engine powers Career Bingo, Math Bingo, Skill Bingo

## üõ†Ô∏è Service Architecture

### Base Class Pattern

```typescript
// Base engine with shared logic
abstract class GameEngine {
  abstract initializeGame(config, content): GameState;
  abstract processInteraction(state, data): InteractionResult;
  abstract checkWinCondition(state): boolean;
  abstract calculateScore(interaction): number;
}

// Specific engines
class BingoEngine extends GameEngine { ... }
class ResourceManagementEngine extends GameEngine { ... }
class DecisionTreeEngine extends GameEngine { ... }
class ScenarioRoleplayEngine extends GameEngine { ... }
```

### Unified Service

```typescript
class DiscoveredLiveArcadeService {
  private engines: Map<string, GameEngine>;

  async startGame(gameCode, studentId)
  async getNextContent(sessionId)
  async submitInteraction(sessionId, interaction)
  async completeSession(sessionId)
  async getLeaderboard(gameCode, type)
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Single service manages all game types
- Shared logic for XP calculation, achievements, leaderboards
- Easy to add new games - just register a new engine

## ü§î Next Steps & Decisions Needed

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   # Apply the new schema
   psql -d pathfinity -f database/migrations/040_arcade_infrastructure.sql
   ```

2. **Migrate Existing Data**
   ```sql
   -- Convert dl_clues to game_content
   INSERT INTO game_content (content_source, content_type, content_data, ...)
   SELECT 'careers', 'clue', jsonb_build_object(...), ...
   FROM dl_clues;
   ```

3. **Build BingoEngine**
   - Start with existing DiscoveredLiveService logic
   - Refactor into BingoEngine class
   - Test with Career Bingo

### Questions for You

1. **Migration Timing**: When should we run the migration?
   - Run now and migrate Career Bingo immediately?
   - Or run in staging first for testing?

2. **Legacy Tables**: After migration, should we:
   - Keep `dl_*` tables for rollback safety?
   - Drop them immediately?
   - Create views for backward compatibility?

3. **Content Generation**: Should I build AI generators for:
   - Resource events?
   - Decision tree nodes?
   - Scenario challenges?
   - (Use CareerBingoClueGenerator as template)

4. **UI Priority**: Which game should we build first after Bingo?
   - Resource Management (career budget challenge)?
   - Decision Tree (career path explorer)?
   - Scenario Roleplay (day in the life)?
