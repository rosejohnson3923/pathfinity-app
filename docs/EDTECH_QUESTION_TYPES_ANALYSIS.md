## Technical Architecture Recommendations

### Question Type Interface
```typescript
interface QuestionBase {
  id: string;
  type: QuestionType;
  question: string;
  instructions?: string;
  media?: {
    type: 'image' | 'video' | 'audio';
    url: string;
    alt?: string;
  };
  metadata: {
    subject: Subject;
    grade: Grade;
    difficulty: 1-10;
    estimatedTime: number;
    skills: string[];
  };
}

interface AnswerValidation {
  correctAnswer: any;
  acceptableAnswers?: any[];
  validationRules?: {
    caseSensitive?: boolean;
    exactMatch?: boolean;
    tolerance?: number;
    partialCredit?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### AI Content Generation Mapping
```typescript
enum AIQuestionType {
  // What we request from AI
  BASIC_RECALL = 'basic_recall',
  COMPREHENSION = 'comprehension',
  APPLICATION = 'application',
  ANALYSIS = 'analysis',
  VISUAL_COUNTING = 'visual_counting',
  PATTERN_RECOGNITION = 'pattern_recognition'
}

// Mapping AI types to rendered question types
const AI_TO_RENDER_MAP = {
  BASIC_RECALL: ['multiple_choice', 'true_false', 'fill_blank'],
  COMPREHENSION: ['multiple_choice', 'short_answer'],
  APPLICATION: ['numeric', 'word_problem'],
  ANALYSIS: ['multiple_answer', 'ordering'],
  VISUAL_COUNTING: ['counting', 'numeric'],
  PATTERN_RECOGNITION: ['multiple_choice', 'drag_drop']
};
```

## Key Insights

1. **Visual Components are Critical**: Almost all platforms support images/media in questions
2. **Immediate Feedback**: All successful platforms provide instant validation
3. **Accessibility**: Audio support and multiple input methods are becoming standard
4. **AI Integration**: 2024 trend toward AI-generated questions and adaptive assessments
5. **Grade-Appropriate Types**: Different question types for different age groups
6. **Engagement Features**: Gamification elements increase completion rates

## Next Steps

1. Define our core question type interfaces
2. Create validation service for each type
3. Build renderer components for each type
4. Establish AI prompt templates for generation
5. Implement accessibility features
6. Add analytics and tracking
