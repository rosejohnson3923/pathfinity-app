## Example Mapped Content

### Teacher + Counting Skill ‚Üí Classroom Organization Scenario

**AI Response:**
```json
{
  "title": "A Day in Ms. Johnson's Classroom",
  "introduction": "Welcome to your classroom! As a teacher, you'll use counting skills every day to organize your students and materials.",
  "challenges": [
    {
      "scenario": "It's the first day of school. You have 30 students arriving and need to organize your classroom supplies. You have boxes of crayons, and each student needs exactly 5 crayons.",
      "question": "What should you do first?",
      "options": [
        "Count how many boxes of crayons you have and calculate if you have enough",
        "Start handing out crayons randomly",
        "Wait for students to ask for crayons",
        "Give some students extra crayons"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Teachers always plan ahead by counting supplies to ensure every student gets what they need.",
      "outcome": "Perfect! You counted 6 boxes with 25 crayons each, giving you 150 crayons total - exactly what you need!",
      "learning_point": "Teachers use multiplication and division daily to manage classroom resources efficiently."
    }
  ],
  "conclusion": "Excellent work! You've shown how teachers use math skills to create organized, fair classrooms where every student has what they need to learn."
}
```

**UI Display:**
1. **Intro Screen**: Shows title and introduction
2. **Challenge Screen**:
   - Displays the classroom scenario
   - Shows "What should you do first?" as the question
   - Presents 4 action options as buttons
3. **Feedback**: Shows outcome and learning point after selection
4. **Completion**: Displays conclusion message

## Notes

- The new format focuses on **storytelling and decision-making** rather than counting exercises
- Each scenario creates **professional immersion** where students experience the career
- Language is **grade-appropriate** through the language constraints system
- No visual emojis needed - the scenarios are descriptive enough
