   - Different companion introductions per grade

2. **ScenarioLayout.tsx** - NOT CREATED  
   - Should adapt layout based on interaction type
   - Different arrangements for visual vs text questions

3. **CompletionLayout.tsx** - NOT CREATED
   - Grade-appropriate celebrations
   - Different stats displays per grade

❌ **responsiveHandler.ts** - NOT CREATED
- Mobile/tablet/desktop adaptations
- Breakpoint management
- Dynamic layout switching

**Gap: No actual layout components, only configuration**

---

## ❌ PHASE 5: Animations & Polish - NOT STARTED

### All Items Missing:
