### Tasks:
- [ ] **1.1** Fix True/False detection priority in AILearningJourneyService.ts
  - Location: `/src/services/AILearningJourneyService.ts` lines 700-719
  - Move True/False pattern check BEFORE counting logic
  - Current bug: Checks `visual && Math && grade<=2` before "True or False:" pattern
  
- [ ] **1.2** Update QuestionTemplateEngine detection logic
  - Location: `/src/services/content/QuestionTemplateEngine.ts`
  - Implement priority-based detection
  - True/False priority = 10, Counting priority = 100

- [ ] **1.3** Test fix with sample True/False questions
  - Test with Grade 10 Math True/False questions
  - Verify no counting detection occurs
  - Document test results

- [ ] **1.4** Verify counting questions ARE correctly detected when explicitly requested
  - Test counting questions for Grade 10 when specifically requested
  - Ensure they work even though marked as "not typically suitable"

- [ ] **1.5** Deploy hotfix to staging environment
  - Run regression tests
  - Verify no side effects

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero True/False questions detected as counting
- ✅ ALL 15 question types correctly detected when requested

FROM question_validation_log 
WHERE grade = '10' 
  AND expected_type = 'true_false'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY type_detected;
