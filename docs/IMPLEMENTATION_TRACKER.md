## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Implementation

1. **Correct answers marked wrong** - ✅ FIXED by type coercion in LearnAIRulesEngine.validateAnswer()
2. **Theme not applying correctly** - ✅ FIXED by ThemeRulesEngine with component-specific overrides
3. **ELA showing math questions** - ✅ FIXED by subject-specific rules in LearnAIRulesEngine.selectQuestionType()
4. **Questions changing before interaction** - ✅ FIXED by state locking in preventRepetition rule
