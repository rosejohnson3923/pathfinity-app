## MATH LESSON: Chef's Smart Kitchen Counter (Led by Spark)

### **Spark's Introduction**
```typescript
// Spark appears in AICompanionModalV2
SPARK: "Hi Sam! It's me, Spark! üé® Today we're going to be chefs together!
        I'll help you learn to count ingredients just like real chefs do.
        Are you ready to cook up some fun with numbers?"
```

### **Learn Section (10 minutes) - Led by Spark**

**Spark's Master Narrative Delivery:**
```typescript
// Delivered through NarrativeLearnContainer with Spark's voice
SPARK: "Welcome to YOUR kitchen, Chef Sam! I'm so excited to help you become
        an amazing chef today. You know what's super cool? Every chef needs to
        know their numbers to make yummy food!"

SPARK: "Let me tell you a secret - even famous chefs like Chef Gordon counts
        his ingredients! When he makes his special soup, he counts: 1 onion,
        2 carrots, 3 potatoes. Want to learn to count like him?"
```

**Spark's Vocabulary Teaching:**
```typescript
// Spark uses visual aids in the interface
SPARK: "Let me teach you some chef words!"
[Shows animated icons as Spark speaks]
- "Ingredient ü•ï - That's the stuff we cook with!"
- "Recipe üìù - It's like instructions for making food!"
- "Count üî¢ - Saying numbers in order, like 1, 2, 3!"
```

### **Instructional Video Section (5 minutes)**

**Spark-Narrated Video:**
```typescript
// InstructionalVideoComponent with Spark overlay
SPARK: "Watch this with me, Sam! I made this video just for you!"

[Video plays with Spark appearing in corner, commenting live]

VIDEO SCENE: Kitchen appears
SPARK: "Look! This is just like the kitchen we'll work in!"

VIDEO SCENE: Ingredients appear
SPARK: "Ooh, here come the vegetables! Let's count together!"
SPARK + SAM: "ONE carrot... TWO tomatoes... THREE potatoes!"

SPARK: "You're doing great! See how the chef uses the same numbers we just learned?"

VIDEO SCENE: Chef makes soup
SPARK: "Without counting, the soup would taste yucky! But with counting, it's PERFECT!"
```

### **Practice Activity with Spark (10 minutes)**

**Spark-Guided Interactive Practice:**
```typescript
// Delivered through existing Practice component with Spark integration

SPARK: "Now it's YOUR turn to be the chef! I'll be your helper!"

// Interactive Kitchen Workspace appears
SPARK: "Look at our kitchen! We need to organize our ingredients.
        Can you help me count them?"

// Drag and drop interface activated
SPARK: "Drag 1 apple to the basket. Great! That's ONE!"
[Sam drags apple]
SPARK: "Perfect! You found ONE apple! üéâ"

SPARK: "Now let's find TWO bananas!"
[Sam drags bananas]
SPARK: "1... 2... Yes! TWO bananas! You're amazing!"

SPARK: "Last one - can you find THREE oranges?"
[Sam completes]
SPARK: "1, 2, 3! WOW! You counted all three! You're a real chef now!"
```

### **Assessment with Spark (5 minutes)**

**Spark-Administered Assessment:**
```typescript
// Assessment module with Spark providing real-time feedback

SPARK: "Let's see what you learned! Don't worry, I'm here to help!"

// Question 1: Visual
SPARK: "Chef Sam needs tomatoes for the sauce. How many do you see?"
[Shows 2 tomatoes]
SAM: [Selects 2]
SPARK: "That's right! TWO tomatoes! You're so smart!"

// Question 2: Voice Input (if enabled)
SPARK: "Can you tell me - how many eggs should we use for the cake?"
SAM: "One!"
SPARK: "YES! One egg is perfect! You remembered!"

// Question 3: Gesture/Touch
SPARK: "Show me 3 fingers like we count 3 peppers!"
[Uses camera/touch to verify]
SPARK: "1, 2, 3 fingers! Excellent counting, Chef Sam!"
```

### **Experience Scenario with Spark**

**"Spark's Restaurant Adventure"**
```typescript
// Delivered through Experience Scenario component

SPARK: "Sam, I need your help! Customers are coming to our restaurant!"

// Interactive scenario begins
SPARK: "Oh! Here comes our first customer!"
CUSTOMER_1 (voiced by Spark): "I'd like 1 sandwich please!"
SPARK: "Sam, how many sandwiches? Can you count?"
SAM: "1!"
SPARK: "Perfect! One sandwich coming up!"

[Pattern continues with 2 cookies, 3 apple slices]

SPARK: "You served everyone perfectly! Our restaurant is a success!"
```

### **Discover Challenge with Spark**

**"Create a Recipe with Spark"**
```typescript
// Discover module with Spark collaboration

SPARK: "Let's create our very own recipe together!"

SPARK: "What's your favorite fruit? Touch the picture!"
[Sam selects strawberries]
SPARK: "Strawberries! Yummy! Should we use 1, 2, or 3?"
SAM: "3!"
SPARK: "3 strawberries it is! Let me write that down..."
[Shows visual recipe card building]

SPARK: "Our recipe is complete! Look what WE made together!"
[Displays illustrated recipe with Sam's choices]

SPARK: "I'm saving this in your Chef Portfolio! Your parents can see it too!"
```

    private narrative: NarrativeLearnContainer,
    private video: InstructionalVideoComponent,
    private practice: PracticeWorkspace, // TO BUILD
    private assessment: AssessmentModule,
    private jit: JustInTimeContentService
  ) {}

  async runLesson(lessonPlan: StandardizedLessonPlan) {
    // 1. Spark introduces lesson
    await this.spark.introduce(lessonPlan);

    // 2. Narrative learning with Spark commentary
    await this.narrative.deliver(lessonPlan.content.narrativeContext);

    // 3. Video with Spark overlay
    await this.video.playWithCompanion(lessonPlan.content.video);

    // 4. Interactive practice with Spark guidance
    await this.practice.runActivity(lessonPlan.content.practice);

    // 5. Assessment with Spark encouragement
    await this.assessment.evaluate(lessonPlan.content.assessment);

    // 6. Celebration and save progress
    await this.spark.celebrate();
  }
}
```

### **Development Priority**

   - SparkLessonOrchestrator
   - Interactive Practice Workspace
   - Visual Recipe Builder

3. **Phase 3 - Enhancement** (Polish)
   - Spark Voice Engine
   - Parent Dashboard
   - Advanced progress tracking

### **No External Dependencies**
