    ├── Skill (constant all day)
    ├── Companion (constant all day)
    └── Subjects[]

## Critical Achievement: Career & Skill Consistency

### User's Top Requirement: ✅ ACHIEVED
> "The Career & skillname for today's lesson plan MUST be maintained across all containers"

**How We Ensure This:**

1. **DailyLearningContextManager**
   - Creates ONE immutable context per day
   - Career and Skill are readonly properties
   - Context persists across page refreshes
   - Every container gets the SAME context

2. **SkillAdaptationService**
   - Adapts skill to each subject WITHOUT changing core objective
   - Every adaptation references the SAME career
   - Examples always use career scenarios

3. **ConsistencyValidator**
   - Validates EVERY piece of content
   - Detects career drift (scores alignment)
   - Detects skill dilution
   - Auto-corrects inconsistencies

4. **PromptTemplateLibrary**
   - EVERY template has {careerTitle} variables
   - EVERY template has {skillName} variables
   - Career and skill injection is MANDATORY

5. **PromptValidator**
   - Validates career presence in prompts
   - Validates skill presence in prompts
   - Tracks failures and optimizes

## Example: How It All Works Together

```typescript
// 1. Daily context created once
const context = DailyLearningContextManager.getInstance().createDailyContext(student);
// Context: Game Developer career, Problem Solving skill, Finn companion

// 2. Skill adapted for Math
const mathAdaptation = SkillAdaptationService.getInstance().adaptSkill(
  context.primarySkill, 'Math', context.career, context.grade
);
// Result: "Use Problem Solving to debug game physics calculations"

// 3. Prompt built with consistency
const prompt = PromptTemplateLibrary.getInstance().buildContextualPrompt(
  context, 'multiple_choice', 'Math', mathAdaptation
);
// Prompt includes: Game Developer references, Problem Solving focus

// 4. Response validated
const validation = ConsistencyValidator.getInstance().validateContent(
  aiResponse, context
);
// Ensures: Career mentioned, skill practiced, grade appropriate

// 5. If inconsistent, auto-correct
if (!validation.isConsistent) {
  const corrected = ConsistencyValidator.getInstance().enforceConsistency(
    aiResponse, context
  );
}
```
