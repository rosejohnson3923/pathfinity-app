### Responsive System:
```typescript
// Automatic responsive configuration
const config = useResponsiveConfig(gradeLevel);
// Returns: breakpoint, grid settings, touch targets, animations
```

### Animation System:
```typescript
// Grade-aware animations
const animations = getAnimationSet(gradeLevel);
// K-2: 600ms transitions, playful
// 9-12: 300ms transitions, professional
```

### Layout Presets:
```typescript
// Screen-specific layouts
const preset = getLayoutPreset('introduction', gradeLevel);
// Returns appropriate layout for grade and screen type
```
