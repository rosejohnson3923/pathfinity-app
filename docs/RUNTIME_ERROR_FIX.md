# Runtime Error Fix - BaseQuestion is not defined

## Date: 2025-08-24
## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

## üö® Error Identified

### Console Error:
```
QuestionTypes.ts:420 Uncaught ReferenceError: BaseQuestion is not defined
    at QuestionTypes.ts:420:3
```

### Root Cause:
The default export in `QuestionTypes.ts` was attempting to export TypeScript interfaces (`BaseQuestion`, `Question`, `QuestionType`) as runtime values. TypeScript interfaces don't exist at runtime - they're compile-time only constructs.

---

## üîß Fix Applied

### File: `/src/services/content/QuestionTypes.ts`

#### Before (INCORRECT):
```typescript
export default {
  // Types
  BaseQuestion,      // ‚ùå Interface - doesn't exist at runtime
  Question,          // ‚ùå Type alias - doesn't exist at runtime  
  QuestionType,      // ‚ùå Type alias - doesn't exist at runtime
  
  // Type Guards
  isMultipleChoice,
  // ... rest
}
```

#### After (CORRECT):
```typescript
export default {
  // Type Guards
  isMultipleChoice,  // ‚úÖ Function - exists at runtime
  isTrueFalse,       // ‚úÖ Function - exists at runtime
  // ... all other type guards and helper functions
  
  // Helpers
  adjustDifficultyForGrade,
  validateQuestion
}
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

### 1. Named Exports Still Available
All TypeScript types are still properly exported as named exports:
```typescript
export interface BaseQuestion { ... }
export type Question = ...
export type QuestionType = ...
```

### 2. No Breaking Changes
- No files were importing the default export
- All imports use named exports: `import { Question, BaseQuestion } from ...`
- Type safety maintained

### 3. Build Success
```bash
‚úì built in 52.79s
```

## üìù Lesson Learned

### TypeScript Runtime vs Compile-Time

**Remember**: 
- **Interfaces** and **type aliases** are TypeScript compile-time constructs
- They DON'T exist at runtime (in JavaScript)
- You can't include them in runtime objects (like default exports)

**Only export at runtime**:
- Functions ‚úÖ
- Classes ‚úÖ
- Constants ‚úÖ
- Objects ‚úÖ

**Keep as type-only exports**:
- Interfaces (use `export interface`)
- Type aliases (use `export type`)
- Type unions (use `export type`)

---

## üéØ Impact

This fix resolves the runtime error that was preventing the question type system from initializing properly. The system can now:
- Load all type guards correctly
- Initialize question validation
- Support all 15 question types at runtime
