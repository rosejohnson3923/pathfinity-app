## 2. Traditional Marketing Press Release

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Pathfinity Launches Revolutionary Learning Platform That Makes Students Beg for More School**

*New Career-First Approach Transforms Education from Burden to Adventure*

**NEW YORK, NY – [DATE]** – Parents nationwide are reporting an unprecedented phenomenon: their children are asking for more learning time. The cause? Pathfinity, a revolutionary education platform that lets students explore real careers while mastering traditional subjects.

The platform addresses education's fundamental disconnect: students constantly asking "when will I use this?" while struggling through abstract concepts. Pathfinity solves this by teaching every subject through the lens of actual careers – from marine biologist to game developer to surgeon.

"My daughter went from crying over homework to voluntarily doing extra lessons," said Jennifer Martinez, mother of a third-grader in California. "She's exploring veterinary science, and suddenly math makes sense because she's calculating medicine dosages for animals."

**Key Innovation: Career-First Learning™**
Students begin each day by choosing from 2,500+ real careers. All lessons – math, science, English, social studies – are then taught through that career lens. A student interested in architecture learns geometry through building design, while one exploring cooking learns fractions through recipe scaling.

**The Technology Behind the Transformation**
Pathfinity's PathIQ™ system uses artificial intelligence to personalize learning across 47 different dimensions, maintaining what psychologists call "flow state" – that perfect balance of challenge and skill where learning feels effortless.

The platform includes:
- Six specialized AI tutors (Finn and friends) available 24/7
- Real-time progress tracking for parents
- Automatic alignment with state standards
- Gamified achievement system without being a game
- Portfolio building for college applications

**Unprecedented Adoption Rate**
Since launching, Pathfinity has seen explosive growth:
- 100,000+ active students
- 500+ schools implemented
- 50,000+ homeschooling families
- 96% retention rate
- Available in all 50 states

"We're not just improving education; we're transforming it," said [CEO Name], Pathfinity's CEO. "When students understand why they're learning, everything changes. Engagement, outcomes, and most importantly, their excitement about the future."

**Affordable Excellence**
At less than $2 per month per student, Pathfinity costs less than a single tutoring session while providing unlimited personalized instruction. Schools report saving thousands by consolidating multiple learning platforms into Pathfinity's comprehensive solution.

**Free Trial Available**
Families can try Pathfinity free for 30 days at www.pathfinity.com. No credit card required.
