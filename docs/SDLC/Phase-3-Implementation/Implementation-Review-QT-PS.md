- **Career-Focused Content**: All support connects to selected career

#### ✅ Container Integration (`/src/components/ai-containers/AILearnContainer.tsx`)
- **Practice Support Lifecycle**:
  - Initialization when entering practice phase
  - Support activation for each question
  - Answer handling integration
  - Transition support between questions
  - Cleanup on phase exit
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "AI Support Active" during practice
- **State Management**: Tracks support status and current support object

### 2.2 Strengths
✅ Comprehensive support at every stage of practice
✅ Adaptive to student struggle patterns
✅ Progressive hint system prevents frustration
✅ Mastery tracking provides learning insights
✅ Career-focused content maintains engagement
✅ Grade-appropriate support levels
✅ Voice integration for accessibility

### 2.3 Areas for Future Enhancement

## 3. Integration Validation

### 3.1 System Cohesion
✅ **Question Types → Practice Support**: Each question type has appropriate support
✅ **AI Generation → Validation → UI**: Complete pipeline works end-to-end
✅ **Voice → Support → Feedback**: Seamless audio experience
✅ **Analytics → Metrics → Mastery**: Data flows through all tracking systems

### 3.2 Data Flow Verification
```
AI Generation → Type Validation → Practice Support Initialization
     ↓                ↓                      ↓
Content Ready → UI Rendering → Student Interaction
     ↓                ↓                      ↓
Analytics → Mastery Tracking → Adaptive Support
```

### 3.3 Edge Cases Handled
✅ Missing practice support data falls back to defaults
✅ Invalid question types are auto-corrected
✅ Speech synthesis failures don't break practice flow
