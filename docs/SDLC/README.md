## 🔑 The Sacred Value Hierarchy

Understanding Pathfinity requires understanding our value hierarchy:

### 1️⃣ PRIMARY VALUE: Career-First Progressive Learning
- Students choose career identities DAILY from kindergarten
- All academic content transforms through career lens
- Creates 13 years of professional experience by graduation
- **This is the revolution** - Not a feature, but our core philosophy

### 2️⃣ SECONDARY VALUE: PathIQ Intelligence System
- Enables Career-First at massive scale
- 47+ dimensions of personalization
- Predictive intervention 30+ days ahead
- Flow state maintenance algorithm
