## 🚀 Next Session Starting Points

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete SDLC Phase Documentation:**
   - ✅ Phase 0: Ideation (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Phase 1: Requirements (PARTIAL - need to finish)
   - ⏳ Phase 2: Design (System Architecture done, need more)
   - ⏳ Phase 3: Development (Standards needed)
   - ⏳ Phase 4: Testing (Strategy needed)
   - ⏳ Phase 5: Deployment (Strategy exists, needs SDLC doc)
   - ⏳ Phase 6: Maintenance (Needed)
   - ⏳ Phase 7: Security & Compliance (Needed)

2. **Deep Dive Areas Identified:**
   - Document the career progression system in detail
   - Create API documentation
   - Document the caching strategy that achieves 80% cost reduction
   - Detail the three-container learning architecture
   - Document Journey Caching system

3. **Code Integration Points:**
   - `/src/services/` - Contains 34+ revolutionary services
   - `/src/components/` - Contains UI implementation
   - Key services to document further:
     - PathIQService
     - AILearningJourneyService
     - UnifiedLearningAnalyticsService
     - CareerBadgeService
     - VectorCareerEmojiService

## 💡 Key Insights & Decisions Made

### Critical Understanding Achieved

1. **Pathfinity is NOT an EdTech tool** - It's an educational paradigm shift
2. **Career-First is NOT a feature** - It's the core philosophy
3. **The hierarchy is SACRED** - Career-First → PathIQ → Finn (in that order)
4. **Every student is a professional** - From Day 1 of kindergarten
5. **The moat is philosophical** - Technology enables it, but philosophy protects it

### Strategic Decisions Documented

1. **No compromise on Career-First** - Any decision that weakens this is rejected
2. **PathIQ enables scale** - Without it, Career-First would be generic
3. **Finn agents execute** - Without them, no multimodal delivery
4. **All three layers required** - Remove any one and the magic disappears
