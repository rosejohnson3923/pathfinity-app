# Toast Notification Issue - Fixed

## Issue Description
The toast notification in LearnContainer > LoadingScreen was displaying as a wide screen overlay instead of a top-of-screen dropdown notification, as shown in the Issue.pdf.

## Root Cause
The toast notification "Welcome! Let's explore [Subject] together" was being triggered in `MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` but was appearing within the loading screen modal area instead of as a separate overlay toast.

## Solution
Removed the toast notifications entirely from `MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx` to prevent the display issue.

## Changes Made

### File: `/src/components/ai-containers/MultiSubjectContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx`

1. **Removed welcome toast notification** (line 281):
   - Removed the useEffect that triggered `toastNotificationService.success(welcomeMessage)` when a character was selected
   - This was causing the wide screen display issue

2. **Removed completion toast notification** (line 375):
   - Removed the "Congratulations! You completed all subjects!" toast
   - Prevents similar display issues at completion

3. **Removed unused import** (line 36):
   - Removed `import { toastNotificationService }` since it's no longer used

## Result
- The toast notification no longer appears as a wide screen overlay
- The loading screen displays correctly without the intrusive notification
- The ToastProvider and ToastContainer components remain in place for future use if needed
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: âœ… Passed
- No build errors
- Toast notifications removed successfully

## Note
The ToastProvider wrapper and ToastContainer component infrastructure remain in place and can be used for proper toast notifications in the future if needed. The issue was specifically with the timing and context of when these toasts were being triggered during the loading state.
