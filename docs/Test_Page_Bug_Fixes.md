# Test Page Bug Fixes - Discovered Live!

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: Questions Skipping Too Fast ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Questions were cycling immediately after the user clicked an answer
- AI players answering would cause the question to skip
- Users didn't have full timer duration to answer
- Game was unplayable - questions flashing by in seconds

**Root Cause:**
In the `handleClick()` function, after the user clicked, the code was immediately calling:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    simulateAI();
    setTimeout(nextQuestion, 2000);
}, 500);
```
This meant the next question would appear just 2.5 seconds after clicking, regardless of the timer.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Timer is now authoritative** - Questions only advance when:
   - Timer reaches 0, OR
   - User manually skips (future feature)

2. **Added `userAnswered` flag** - Prevents double-answering:
```javascript
if (game.userAnswered) return; // Already answered this question
game.userAnswered = true; // Mark that user has answered
```

3. **AI players answer independently** - They answer at random times (1-10s delay) during the question:
```javascript
const delay = Math.random() * 9000 + 1000; // 1-10 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    // AI answers without affecting question flow
}, delay);
```

4. **Removed immediate `nextQuestion()` call** from `handleClick()`

**Result:**
✅ Each question displays for the full timer duration (default 15 seconds)
✅ User has time to read the clue and find the career on their card
✅ AI players answer throughout the question period
✅ Question only advances when timer expires

### Bug #2: Bot Names Not Human-Like ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Players named "QuickBot", "SmartBot", "CleverBot", etc.
- Made it obvious they were bots
- Didn't feel like real multiplayer

**Fix Applied:**
Changed AI player names to human names with initials:
```javascript
// Before
const aiNames = ['QuickBot', 'SteadyBot', 'SmartBot', ...];

// After
const aiNames = ['Aaron B.', 'Jessica M.', 'Marcus L.', 'Sophia K.', 'Tyler R.'];
```

**Result:**
✅ Players feel like real people
✅ More immersive multiplayer experience
✅ Still shows 🤖 icon to indicate AI (for testing)

---

### Bug #3: Grid Generation Infinite Loop ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Careers array had only 24 items
- Bingo grid needs 25 unique careers (5×5)
- Code would hang trying to find a 25th unique career

**Fix Applied:**
Added "Accountant" 💰 as the 25th career:
```javascript
const careers = [
    'Chef', 'Teacher', 'Doctor', ..., 'Plumber', 'Accountant'
]; // Now has 25 careers
```

**Result:**
✅ Grid generates successfully every time
✅ No more infinite loops
✅ Game starts properly

## Technical Implementation Details

### How the Timer System Works Now:

```javascript
function nextQuestion() {
    // Set up new question
    game.currentQ = questions[...];
    game.lastQ = game.currentQ; // Track for AI
    game.userAnswered = false; // Reset flag
    game.timer = 15;

    // Start AI players answering at random times
    simulateAI(); // They answer independently

    // Start countdown timer
    startTimer(); // Only this advances to next question
}

function startTimer() {
    game.timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
        game.timer--;
        if (game.timer <= 0) {
            clearInterval(game.timerInterval);
            setTimeout(nextQuestion, 1500); // ONLY place nextQuestion is called
        }
    }, 1000);
}

function handleClick(idx, career) {
    if (game.userAnswered) return; // Can only answer once

    // Process user's answer
    if (correct) {
        // Award points, check bingos, etc.
    }

    game.userAnswered = true; // Mark as answered
    // NOTE: Does NOT call nextQuestion() anymore!
}
```

### How AI Players Work Now:

```javascript
function simulateAI() {
    game.players.slice(1).forEach((p, idx) => {
        // Each AI gets random delay between 1-10 seconds
        const delay = Math.random() * 9000 + 1000;

        setTimeout(() => {
            // Safety checks
            if (!game.running) return;
            if (game.currentQ !== game.lastQ) return; // Question changed

            // AI answers based on difficulty
            if (Math.random() < p.diff) {
                p.correct++;
                p.xp += 10;
                log(`✅ ${p.name} answered correctly!`);
            } else {
                log(`❌ ${p.name} answered incorrectly`);
            }
            renderPlayers(); // Update leaderboard
        }, delay);
    });
}
```

Key points:
- Each AI player gets a different random delay
- They answer independently of each other
- They answer independently of the user
- They don't affect question timing
- If question changes before their delay fires, they don't answer (safety check)

## Testing the Fixes

### Expected Behavior:

**Question 1 starts:**
- Timer: 15s
- User reads: "I prepare delicious meals"
- After 3s: "✅ Aaron B. answered correctly!"
- After 5s: "✅ Jessica M. answered correctly!"
- User clicks "Chef" at 8s: "✅ You clicked Chef. Correct!" (+10 XP, square unlocks)
- After 11s: "❌ Marcus L. answered incorrectly"
- Timer continues: 4s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 0s
- At 0s: "⏰ Time up!"
- After 1.5s delay: **Question 2 starts**

**Key Points:**
✅ Full 15 seconds per question
✅ AI players answer throughout
✅ User can answer anytime during the 15 seconds
✅ User can only answer once per question
✅ Question doesn't advance until timer expires
✅ Leaderboard updates as players answer
