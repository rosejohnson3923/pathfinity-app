## What Is This?

This enhancement proposes migrating PDF generation from client-side, on-demand processing to a cloud-based batch processing system using Azure services. This enables:

1. **Dual PDF Delivery:**
   - **Demonstrative PDF** - Preview generated overnight before student starts
   - **Actual PDF** - Results generated within 60 seconds after completion

2. **50% Cost Savings:**
   - Azure OpenAI Batch API costs half of real-time API
   - For 10,000 students: Save **$35,000/year**

3. **Better User Experience:**
   - Parents preview tomorrow's lesson at breakfast
   - Near-instant results PDF after completion
   - Email/SMS notifications when ready

4. **Scalability:**
   - Support 10,000+ students per district
   - Auto-scaling based on demand
   - Zero downtime deployments

## Should We Build This?

### ‚úÖ Build If:

- Targeting **school districts** (1,000+ students)
- Cost optimization is a priority
- Want to build parent engagement features
- Planning MS365 integration pathway

### ‚ùå Don't Build If:

- Only serving individual schools (< 500 students)
- Current PDF generation is sufficient
- Resources needed elsewhere
- ROI payback period > 3 years

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **When to build** | Q2 2026 | After product-market fit with districts |
| **Minimum deployment size** | 1,000 students | 5-year ROI payback acceptable |
| **Batch API vs Real-time** | Batch for demonstrative, Real-time fallback | 50% savings worth 24hr processing window |
| **Queue technology** | Azure Service Bus | Enterprise-grade reliability, retries, dead-letter |
| **Storage** | Azure Blob Storage (Hot tier) | Balance cost vs access speed |
| **Monitoring** | Application Insights | Native Azure integration |
