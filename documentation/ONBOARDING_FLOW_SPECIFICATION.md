## 🔄 **Role Preference Selection System**

### **Core Principle**
During onboarding, users choose their preferred role context - this is **mutually exclusive** and determines dashboard labeling, NOT functionality. The underlying product capabilities remain identical.

### **Role Options**

#### **Teacher Preference**
- **Dashboard Labels**: "Teacher Dashboard" + "Student Dashboard"
- **User Mindset**: "I manage curriculum, set learning objectives, track academic progress"
- **Perfect For**: Educators, Homeschool Teachers, Curriculum Managers
- **Features Emphasized**: Curriculum management, lesson planning, class analytics, learning objectives

#### **Parent Preference**  
- **Dashboard Labels**: "Parent Dashboard" + "Child Dashboard"
- **User Mindset**: "I monitor my children's learning progress and support their educational journey"
- **Perfect For**: Parents, Guardians, Family Learning Coordinators
- **Features Emphasized**: Child progress monitoring, family learning insights, supporting milestones

### **Key Design Decision**
Users **cannot switch** between roles after registration. This eliminates complexity and ensures clear, consistent user experience.

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Components Created**

2. **`OnboardingFlow.tsx`** - Orchestrates complete onboarding process
3. **Updated `TeacherDashboard.tsx`** - Dynamic tab labels based on user role
4. **Updated `mockAuthData.ts`** - Parent users and family tenants

### **Data Structure**

#### **User Role Field**
```typescript
role: 'educator' | 'parent' | 'student' | 'school_admin' | 'district_admin' | 'product_admin'
```

#### **Parent-Child Relationships**
```typescript
// Parent users include children array
children: string[] // Array of child user IDs
```
