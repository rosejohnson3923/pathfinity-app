## Cost Monitoring Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Cost per Student Day**: Target < $0.05
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Target > 85%
- **API Calls per Journey**: Target < 5
- **Tool Session Cost**: Target < $0.002

### Monitoring Dashboard Queries
```sql
-- Daily cost per student
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) as students,
  SUM(api_cost + infra_cost) as total_cost,
  SUM(api_cost + infra_cost) / COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) as cost_per_student
FROM cost_tracking
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Cache effectiveness
SELECT 
  cache_type,
  COUNT(*) as requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN cache_hit THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as hits,
  AVG(CASE WHEN cache_hit THEN cost ELSE 0 END) as avg_hit_cost,
  AVG(CASE WHEN NOT cache_hit THEN cost ELSE 0 END) as avg_miss_cost
FROM cache_metrics
GROUP BY cache_type;
```

## Decision Framework

### When Adding New Features
1. Calculate base cost per user interaction
2. Estimate cache hit rate potential
3. Project monthly cost at 10K students
4. Compare to educational value delivered
5. Identify optimization opportunities

### Cost Thresholds
- **Green Light**: < $0.001 per interaction
- **Review Required**: $0.001 - $0.01 per interaction
- **Optimization Needed**: > $0.01 per interaction

## Appendix: Cost Calculation Formulas

### Total Platform Cost
```
Monthly Cost = (Students × Days × Journeys/Day × Cost/Journey) + Fixed Infrastructure
```

### Effective Tool Cost
```
Tool Cost = (Cache Hit Rate × Cache Cost) + ((1 - Cache Hit Rate) × Full Cost)
```

### ROI Calculation
```
ROI = (Cost Savings - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost × 100
```
