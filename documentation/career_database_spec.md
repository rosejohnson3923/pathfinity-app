## Career Scenario Templates

### Elementary Scenario Examples
**File:** `database/seeds/scenarios_elementary.js`

```javascript

### Career Selection API (Updated for Multi-Subject)
**File:** `api/careerSelection.js`

```javascript
// GET /api/careers/choices
export const getCareerChoices = async (req, res) => {
  const { studentId, learnResults, gradeLevel } = req.query;
  
  try {
    // Get student's career profile
    const careerProfile = await getCareerAnalytics(studentId);
    
    // Generate career choices based on multi-subject learning
    const choices = await generateCareerChoices({
      gradeLevel: parseInt(gradeLevel),
      learnResults: JSON.parse(learnResults),
      careerProfile: careerProfile
    });
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      choices: choices,
      metadata: {
        generated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        personalization_applied: careerProfile.hasStrongPreferences,
        subjects_integrated: extractSubjectsFromChoices(choices),
        skills_applicable: extractSkillsFromChoices(choices)
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    });
  }
};

// POST /api/careers/choice-selected
export const trackCareerChoice = async (req, res) => {
  const { studentId, presentedChoices, selectedCareer, selectionTime, learnResults } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Track the multi-subject choice event
    await trackMultiSubjectCareerChoiceEvent({
      studentId,
      presentedChoices,
      selectedCareer,
      selectionTime,
      learnResults,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    // Generate multi-subject scenario for selected career
    const scenario = await generateMultiSubjectCareerScenario(selectedCareer, learnResults);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      scenario: scenario,
      analytics_updated: true,
      subjects_integrated: scenario.subjectsIntegrated
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    });
  }
};

// Helper functions for multi-subject integration
export const extractSubjectsFromChoices = (choices) => {
  const subjects = new Set();
  choices.forEach(choice => {
    if (choice.subjectIntegration) {
      Object.keys(choice.subjectIntegration).forEach(subject => subjects.add(subject));
    }
  });
  return Array.from(subjects);
};

export const extractSkillsFromChoices = (choices) => {
  const skills = [];
  choices.forEach(choice => {
    if (choice.skillApplications) {
      Object.values(choice.skillApplications).forEach(app => {
        skills.push(`${app.skill} (${choice.name})`);
      });
    }
  });
  return skills;
};
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Run migration scripts to create tables
2. **Seed Data**: Load initial career content for all grade levels
3. **API Development**: Build career selection and tracking endpoints
4. **Integration Testing**: Test career choice flow end-to-end
5. **Content Expansion**: Add more careers and scenarios based on testing feedback

This provides Claude Code with a complete database foundation and initial content to build the career selection system!
