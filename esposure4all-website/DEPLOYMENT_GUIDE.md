     Type: CNAME Name: www  Value: [your-site-name].netlify.app
     ```

3. **Option B: Transfer DNS to Netlify**
   - In Netlify: Go to Domain settings
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: Esposure4All.org
   - Netlify will provide nameservers:

     dns2.p01.nsone.net
     dns3.p01.nsone.net
     dns4.p01.nsone.net
     ```

   - Click "Verify DNS configuration"
   - Once verified, click "Provision certificate"
   - Wait for Let's Encrypt certificate (usually 5-10 minutes)

### Phase 5: Verification

1. **DNS Propagation Check**
   - Visit https://www.whatsmydns.net/
   - Enter Esposure4All.org
   - Check A record propagation globally
   - Full propagation: 24-48 hours

2. **Test All Variations**
   - http://Esposure4All.org (should redirect to HTTPS)
   - https://Esposure4All.org (primary)
   - http://www.Esposure4All.org (should redirect)
   - https://www.Esposure4All.org (should redirect to non-www)

2. **Set Up Continuous Deployment**
   - Any push to `main` branch auto-deploys
   - Consider branch protection for production

3. **Monitor Site**
   - Check Netlify dashboard for build status
   - Set up uptime monitoring (optional)
   - Configure analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)

   - Check domain configuration
   - Wait for propagation
