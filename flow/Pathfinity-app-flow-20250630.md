Our conversation has covered several key areas:

Design Standards: You set the initial design expectations, emphasizing production-ready, visually appealing web pages using the existing tech stack (JSX, Tailwind CSS, React hooks, Lucide React icons).
UI Text Change: We addressed your request to change "Enhanced Dashboard Mode" to "Enhanced Dashboard View" in the application's UI.
Persistent Dark Mode: The primary focus has been on implementing a persistent dark mode. You requested that the application load in dark mode by default and that this preference be saved across sessions, which was achieved by modifying the useTheme.ts hook to store the theme choice in local storage.
