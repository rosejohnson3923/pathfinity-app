# Production-Ready Data Generation System

## Overview
A comprehensive system for generating educational content and transactional data for both testing and production customer migration.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Intelligent Test Bed (Current)
- Generate comprehensive educational content for all grade levels
- Create realistic student interaction patterns
- Populate analytics tables for dashboard testing

### Phase 2: Production Migration (Future)
- Customer data import and transformation
- Realistic transactional data generation based on actual usage patterns
- Historical data backfill for analytics

## Data Generation Components

### 1. Content Generation Engine
**Purpose**: Create all educational materials once, use everywhere
**Scope**: 
- All subjects (Math, Science, ELA, Social Studies)
- All grade levels (Pre-K through 12th)
- All learning containers (Learn, Experience, Discover)
- All career scenarios

**Output**: 
- ~50,000+ learning content items
- ~200,000+ assessment questions with validated answers
- ~1,000+ career scenarios across grade levels

### 2. Student Activity Simulator
**Purpose**: Generate realistic learning patterns for testing and analytics
**Features**:
- Varied learning styles and paces
- Realistic session timing patterns
- Natural progression and struggle points
- Engagement level variations
- Career exploration diversity

### 3. Customer Migration Pipeline
**Purpose**: Convert existing customer data to Pathfinity format
**Capabilities**:
- Student profile transformation
- Progress mapping from external systems
- Realistic activity backfill
- Performance analytics generation

### 4. Transactional Data Generator
**Purpose**: Create ongoing realistic student activity
**Features**:
- Daily learning session generation
- Assessment attempt patterns
- Progress tracking updates
- Teacher intervention simulations
- Parent engagement metrics
