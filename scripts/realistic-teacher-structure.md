## Benefits for Teacher/Admin Portal Testing:

### Teacher Portal Testing:
- **Subject-Specific Insights**: Each teacher sees only their subject data
- **Cross-Student Comparisons**: Ms Jenna can compare Alex vs Sam in Math
- **Teaching Style Impact**: Compare hands-on (Ms Jenna) vs project-based (Mr Land)
- **Subject Performance**: ELA teachers vs Math teachers vs Science teachers

### Admin Portal Testing:
- **Department Analysis**: Which Math teacher has highest success rates?
- **Subject Comparisons**: Is Science outperforming Social Studies district-wide?
- **Teacher Effectiveness**: Performance comparison across similar subjects
- **Resource Allocation**: Which departments need more support?

### Realistic Data Patterns:
- **Student Schedules**: Realistic daily subject rotation
- **Teacher Workloads**: Appropriate student-to-teacher ratios
- **Subject Correlations**: Math performance vs Science performance
- **Intervention Targeting**: Subject-specific support recommendations

This structure provides **much richer analytics** for both Teacher and Admin portals while reflecting real school organizational patterns!
