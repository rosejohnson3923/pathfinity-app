- **Required**: Prevent reverting changes, eliminate conflicts
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **What we did**:

- **Required**: Clean theme system for gradual adoption
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **What we did**:
  - Created `/src/design-system/` directory
  - Built comprehensive token system
  - Created migration guide
  - Built example components

## 🔍 Gaps Identified

### 1. **DiscoverContainer Not Fully Migrated**
- Only partially updated in earlier attempts
- Needs full token integration like ExperienceContainer

### 2. **Test Page Not Working**
- Created test page but couldn't access due to routing issues
- HTML test file created but not accessible
- Should verify changes work in actual app

### 3. **Component Inline Styles**
- BentoExperienceCard still has `getContainerStyles()` with inline styles
- Should be fully migrated to CSS classes

### 4. **Not All Hardcoded Values Replaced**
- Found ~30 instances of pixel values still in BentoExperienceCard.module.css
- Need to complete token replacement

### 5. **Theme Service Integration**
- Design system created but not integrated with ThemeService
- Need to ensure `data-theme` attribute is properly set

## 📝 Action Items to Complete

### High Priority:
1. [ ] Complete DiscoverContainer migration
2. [ ] Remove remaining inline styles from BentoExperienceCard
3. [ ] Replace remaining hardcoded pixel values
4. [ ] Test in actual app (navigate to Experience/Learn/Discover)

### Medium Priority:
5. [ ] Integrate design system with ThemeService
6. [ ] Update BaseContainer.css to use tokens
7. [ ] Document which components are migrated

### Low Priority:
8. [ ] Create working test route
9. [ ] Add more example migrations
10. [ ] Create automated migration script

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Design System Structure** - Complete foundation in place
2. **Token Definitions** - All tokens defined and documented
3. **BentoExperienceCard** - Partially migrated to tokens
4. **ExperienceContainer** - Using design tokens
5. **LearnContainer** - Width management restored with tokens
6. **Dark Theme Contrast** - Improved text colors for better readability
7. **Migration Guide** - Complete documentation for gradual adoption

## 🚀 Next Steps
