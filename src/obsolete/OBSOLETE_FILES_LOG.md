# OBSOLETE FILES LOG

## Date: 2025-09-13
## Purpose: Track files moved during Experience Container refactor

### FILES MOVED TO OBSOLETE:

#### Experience Container Files:
1. **AIExperienceContainer.tsx**
   - Status: V1 implementation
   - Replaced by: AIExperienceContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx
   - Reason: Old version with inline styles and no rules engine

2. **AIExperienceContainerV2.tsx**
   - Status: V2 intermediate version
   - Replaced by: AIExperienceContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx
   - Reason: Superseded by unified version with JIT performance

3. **AIExperienceContainerV2-JIT.tsx**
   - Status: V2 performance variant
   - Replaced by: AIExperienceContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx
   - Reason: Features merged into unified version

4. **BentoExperienceCard.tsx**
   - Status: V1 card component
   - Replaced by: BentoExperienceCardV2.tsx
   - Reason: Old implementation with poor style management

5. **ExperienceContainer.tsx** (from containers folder)
   - Status: Old wrapper
   - Replaced by: AIExperienceContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx
   - Reason: Redundant wrapper component

6. **ExperienceMasterContainer.tsx**
   - Status: Unused
   - Replaced by: N/A
   - Reason: Never integrated into application

### ACTIVE FILES REMAINING:
- AIExperienceContainerV2-UNIFIED.tsx (Main container)
- BentoExperienceCardV2.tsx (Current card implementation)
- AIExperienceContainerV2.module.css (Styles for V2)
- BentoExperienceCard.module.css (Styles for card)

### IMPORT UPDATES REQUIRED:
Files that import obsolete components need updating:
- MultiSubjectContainer.tsx
- AIThreeContainerJourney.tsx
- ContainerRouter.tsx (already using V2-UNIFIED)

### NEXT STEPS:
1. Move files to /obsolete/experience/
2. Update remaining imports
3. Test application
4. Once confirmed working, proceed with refactor
5. Delete /obsolete folder after successful implementation
