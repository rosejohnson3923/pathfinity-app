CRITICAL - QUESTION TYPE RULES:

You MUST use ONLY these exact types for grade ${student.grade_level}:
${typeExamples}

STRICT RULES BY SUBJECT:

MATH RULES:
1. "How many" questions for K-2 ‚Üí type MUST be "counting" with visual
2. "How many" questions for 3+ ‚Üí type MUST be "numeric"
3. Counting type MUST include visual field with emojis
4. Can use all types: counting, numeric, multiple_choice, true_false

ELA RULES:
1. NEVER use "counting" type - even if asking about quantity
2. Letter identification ‚Üí "multiple_choice" with letter options
3. Phonics/rhyming ‚Üí "multiple_choice" with word options
4. True/False for reading comprehension only
5. Never ask "How many letters" - ask "Which letter" instead

SCIENCE RULES:
1. NEVER use "counting" type
2. Use "true_false" for all true/false questions
3. For text-only: set visual="‚ùì"
4. For visual support: use appropriate emojis
4. Use "multiple_choice" for categorization (Which animal lives in water?)
5. Observations ‚Üí "multiple_choice" (What happens when ice melts?)
6. Never count objects - classify or describe them instead

SOCIAL STUDIES RULES:
1. NEVER use "counting" type
2. Community helpers ‚Üí "multiple_choice" (Who helps when sick?)
3. Geography ‚Üí "true_false" for all questions (visual="‚ùì" for text-only)
4. Cultural topics ‚Üí "multiple_choice" with descriptive options
5. Focus on relationships and roles, not quantities

GENERAL RULES:
1. ONLY use types from the approved list for the grade
2. Multiple choice MUST have exactly 4 options
3. True/False questions MUST start with "True or False:"
4. ALWAYS include visual field - use "‚ùì" when no visual needed
5. true_false correct_answer MUST be boolean (true/false), NOT strings

CORRECT EXAMPLES (Even for "Counting to 3" skill, use VARIED types):

{
  "question": "True or False: The ${career?.name || 'doctor'} counted 3 tools.",
  "type": "true_false",  // ‚úÖ Always use true_false
  "visual": "üîßüîßüîß",  // Visual support for the question
  "correct_answer": true,  // ‚úÖ Boolean, not string!
  "hint": "Look at the visual and count",
  "explanation": "Yes! There are exactly 3 tools."
}

// Example of text-only true/false:
{
  "question": "True or False: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.",
  "type": "true_false",
  "visual": "‚ùì",  // ‚úÖ Placeholder for text-only questions
  "correct_answer": true,  // ‚úÖ Boolean value
  "hint": "Think about ice",
  "explanation": "Water freezes at 0¬∞C or 32¬∞F"
}

{
  "question": "How many ${career?.name === 'Doctor' ? 'stethoscopes' : career?.name === 'Athlete' ? 'basketballs' : 'tools'} do you see?",
  "type": "counting",  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: counting type when asking "how many" with visual
  "visual": "${career?.name === 'Doctor' ? 'ü©∫ ü©∫ ü©∫' : career?.name === 'Athlete' ? 'üèÄ üèÄ üèÄ' : 'üîß üîß üîß'}",
  "correct_answer": 3,  // ‚úÖ Number, not string!
  "hint": "Count each one carefully",
  "explanation": "There are 3!"
}

{
  "question": "The ${career?.name || 'chef'} prepared 3 meals. How many meals is that?",
  "type": "multiple_choice",  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: multiple_choice for counting practice
  "options": ["2 meals", "3 meals", "4 meals", "5 meals"],
  "correct_answer": 1,
  "hint": "Read the question carefully",
  "explanation": "The chef prepared 3 meals!"
}

ELA LETTER EXAMPLES (NEVER use counting for these!):

{
  "question": "Which letter does the ${career?.name || 'teacher'} need for the word 'CAT'?",
  "type": "multiple_choice",  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: multiple_choice for letter identification
  "options": ["B", "C", "D", "E"],
  "correct_answer": 1,
  "hint": "Look at the first letter of CAT",
  "explanation": "The letter C starts the word CAT!"
}

{
  "question": "The ${career?.name || 'chef'} sees this letter on the menu: G. Which letter is it?",
  "type": "multiple_choice",  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: NOT counting even though ELA
  "options": ["E", "F", "G", "H"],
  "correct_answer": 2,
  "hint": "Look carefully at the shape",
  "explanation": "That's the letter G!"
}

‚ùå WRONG for ELA: "How many letters are in the word DOG?" - Don't ask counting questions for ELA!
‚úÖ RIGHT for ELA: "Which letter comes first: D, O, or G?" - Ask about letter identification
`;

    // CAREER-FIRST LEARNING PROMPT
    const careerContext = career ? `
CAREER CONTEXT (MOST IMPORTANT):
${student.display_name} wants to be a ${career.name}!
ALL content MUST show how a ${career.name} uses ${skill.skill_name} in their daily work.
- Every example must be about what a ${career.name} does
- Every practice question must relate to ${career.name} tasks
- Every visual should show ${career.name}-related scenarios
- Make ${student.display_name} feel like they're training to be a real ${career.name}!

CRITICAL - INDUSTRY-APPROPRIATE ITEMS ONLY:
You MUST use items that are ACTUALLY used in the ${career.name} profession/industry:
${career.name === 'Athlete' ? `
- ‚úÖ CORRECT for Athletes: sports water bottles (NOT baby bottles!), basketballs, soccer balls, tennis balls, running shoes, jerseys, medals, trophies, cones, hurdles, weights
- ‚ùå WRONG for Athletes: baby bottles, feeding bottles, regular household items, non-sports items
- Use specific sports equipment and athletic gear ONLY
- When mentioning water, ALWAYS say "sports water bottles" or "sports drinks" - NEVER just "bottles"
` : career.name === 'Doctor' ? `
- ‚úÖ CORRECT for Doctors: stethoscopes, medical charts, thermometers, bandages, medicine bottles, syringes, gloves
- ‚ùå WRONG for Doctors: unrelated tools, kitchen items
- Use actual medical equipment and healthcare items ONLY
` : career.name === 'Teacher' ? `
- ‚úÖ CORRECT for Teachers: pencils, books, whiteboards, markers, notebooks, rulers, globes, computers
- ‚ùå WRONG for Teachers: unrelated professional tools
- Use actual classroom and educational items ONLY
` : career.name === 'Chef' ? `
- ‚úÖ CORRECT for Chefs: pots, pans, chef knives, spatulas, ingredients, plates, recipes, aprons
- ‚ùå WRONG for Chefs: medical equipment, sports items
- Use actual kitchen and culinary items ONLY
` : `
- Use items that professionals in this field ACTUALLY use
- Avoid generic or unrelated items
- Be specific to the ${career.name} industry
`}

IMPORTANT: Every single item, scenario, and example MUST be authentic to what a real ${career.name} would encounter in their professional life!
` : '';

    // Adaptive instruction based on practice performance
    const adaptiveContext = practiceResults ? `
ADAPTIVE INSTRUCTION BASED ON PRACTICE:
The student just completed diagnostic practice with ${practiceResults.correct}/${practiceResults.total} correct.
${practiceResults.struggles.length > 0 ? `Areas of struggle: ${practiceResults.struggles.join(', ')}` : ''}
ADJUST INSTRUCTION ACCORDINGLY:
- If performance was weak (< 50%), focus on fundamentals and basics
- If performance was moderate (50-80%), balance review with new concepts  
- If performance was strong (> 80%), move quickly to advanced applications
- Address specific struggle areas directly in examples

SKILL TO TEACH: ${skill.skill_name}
SUBJECT: ${skill.subject}
STUDENT GRADE: ${student.grade_level}
STUDENT NAME: ${student.display_name}

SUBJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ${skill.subject.toUpperCase()}:
${skill.subject === 'Math' ? `
Mathematics Content:
- Focus on numerical concepts, patterns, arithmetic, geometry, measurement
- Use counting, comparison, addition, subtraction appropriate for grade ${student.grade_level}
- Include visual representations of mathematical concepts
- Practice problems should involve calculations, number recognition, or pattern identification
${skill.skill_name.includes('up to 3') ? `

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NUMBER LIMIT FOR THIS SKILL: "up to 3" means MAXIMUM OF 3!
- ALL numbers in questions MUST be 3 or less (never 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.)
- ALL visual counts MUST show 3 items or fewer
- ALL answers MUST be 3 or less
- Examples: ‚úÖ "2 water bottles", ‚úÖ "3 basketballs", ‚ùå "5 trophies", ‚ùå "7 soccer balls"
- When creating visuals: ‚úÖ "‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ" (3 items), ‚ùå "‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ" (5 items)` : ''}
` : skill.subject === 'ELA' ? `
English Language Arts Content:
- Focus on reading, writing, phonics, vocabulary, grammar
- Include letter recognition, word families, sentence structure for grade ${student.grade_level}
- Practice comprehension, spelling, and language usage
- Questions should test literacy skills like rhyming, alphabetical order, or word meanings
` : skill.subject === 'Science' ? `
Science Content:
- Focus on natural world, living things, physical properties, earth science
- Include observations, predictions, cause and effect for grade ${student.grade_level}
- Practice scientific thinking and basic concepts
- Questions should explore nature, animals, weather, materials, or simple experiments
` : skill.subject === 'Social Studies' ? `
Social Studies Content:
- Focus on community, geography, history, cultures, citizenship
- Include people, places, traditions appropriate for grade ${student.grade_level}
- Practice understanding society and relationships
- Questions should cover families, jobs, maps, holidays, or community helpers
` : `General ${skill.subject} content appropriate for grade ${student.grade_level}`}

IMPORTANT - NEW PHASE ORDER:
This follows Practice ‚Üí Instruction ‚Üí Assessment flow.
- Practice questions are DIAGNOSTIC (testing prior knowledge)
- Instruction should ADAPT based on practice performance
- Assessment questions must be DIFFERENT from practice questions

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION ABOUT QUESTION TYPES:
The skill name "${skill.skill_name}" describes WHAT to teach, NOT the question types to use.
Even if the skill is "Counting to 3", you should use VARIED question types:
- Some questions can be counting type (with visuals)
- Some should be true_false (e.g., "True or False: The doctor counted 3 tools")
- Some should be multiple_choice (e.g., "How many items did the chef prepare? a) 2 b) 3 c) 4 d) 5")
DO NOT make all questions the same type just because of the skill name!
${typeInstructions}
${career && (student.grade_level === 'K' || student.grade_level === '1' || student.grade_level === '2') ? `
KINDERGARTEN/EARLY ELEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use VERY simple vocabulary (5-6 year old level)
- Keep numbers small (1-10 for K, 1-20 for grade 1-2)
- Use familiar, concrete objects
- Make career connections simple and fun
- Example for ${career.name === 'Doctor' ? 'Doctor' : career.name}:
  ${career.name === 'Doctor' ? 
    `- "Let's help people feel better by counting!"
     - "Count the happy faces after the doctor helps!"
     - "How many toys are in the doctor's waiting room?"` :
  career.name === 'Teacher' ?
    `- "Count the books on the teacher's desk!"
     - "How many friends are in our classroom?"
     - "Let's count the crayons we need!"` :
  career.name === 'Firefighter' ?
    `- "Count the fire trucks!"
     - "How many helpers does the firefighter need?"
     - "Let's count the safety hats!"` :
    `- "Count items that ${career.name}s use!"
     - "How many tools does a ${career.name} need?"
     - "Let's count together like a ${career.name}!"`}

VISUAL EMOJI GUIDANCE - USE INDUSTRY-APPROPRIATE EMOJIS ONLY:
${career.name === 'Athlete' ? `
For Athletes, use these emojis ONLY:
- Water: üíß or ü•§ (sports drink), NEVER üçº (baby bottle)
- Balls: ‚öΩ üèÄ üèà ‚öæ üéæ üèê (specific sports balls)
- Equipment: üëü (running shoes), üèÉ (runner), üèÖ (medal), üèÜ (trophy)

- Classroom: üñäÔ∏è (pen), üìê (ruler), üåç (globe), üíª (computer)
` : career.name === 'Chef' ? `
For Chefs, use these emojis ONLY:
- Food: üç≥ (cooking), ü•ò (pot), üçΩÔ∏è (plate), ü•Ñ (spoon)
- Kitchen: üë®‚Äçüç≥ (chef), üî™ (knife), üßë‚Äçüç≥ (cook)
` : `Use profession-appropriate emojis ONLY`}

Generate a complete learning journey with:

1. PRACTICE PHASE (DIAGNOSTIC - Comes FIRST):
   - EXACTLY 5 diagnostic questions to test PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (MUST BE 5 QUESTIONS, NOT 3!)
   - These are exploratory questions to see what student already knows
   - Use ONLY these types: ${availableTypes.join(', ')}
   - Start simple and increase difficulty progressively
   - Mix different question types for variety
   - Questions should test understanding WITHOUT teaching first
   - CRITICAL: Questions MUST be specific to ${skill.subject}:
     ${skill.subject === 'Math' ? `
     * Math: Focus on numbers, counting, arithmetic, patterns, shapes, measurements
     * Example: "How many ${career ? career.name + ' tools' : 'objects'} do you see?"
     * Example: "What number comes after 5?"
     * Example: "Which shape has 3 sides?"` : 
     skill.subject === 'ELA' ? `
     * ELA: Focus on letters, words, reading, phonics, vocabulary, sentence structure
     * NEVER ask "How many letters" - instead ask "Which letter is this?" or "Find the letter X"
     * Example: "Which letter comes first in the alphabet: B or D?"
     * Example: "What rhymes with 'cat'?"
     * Example: "Which word means the same as 'happy'?"
     * Example: "Which letter is this: E, G, H, or J?" (for letter identification)` :
     skill.subject === 'Science' ? `
     * Science: Focus on nature, animals, weather, plants, body parts, basic physics
     * NEVER ask counting questions (not "How many legs does a spider have?")
     * Example: "True or False: Plants need water to grow"
     * Example: "Which animal lives in water: bird, fish, cat, or dog?"
     * Example: "What happens to ice when it gets warm: melts, freezes, grows, or flies?"` :
     skill.subject === 'Social Studies' ? `
     * Social Studies: Focus on community, family, jobs, maps, holidays, cultures
     * NEVER ask counting questions (not "How many people in a family?")
     * Example: "Who helps us when we're sick: doctor, baker, artist, or swimmer?"
     * Example: "True or False: The 4th of July is America's birthday"
     * Example: "Which is bigger: your house or your city?"`
     : `* General subject-appropriate questions for ${skill.subject}`}
   - Each question MUST include full practice support:
     * Pre-question context connecting to ${career ? `${career.name}` : 'real world'}
     * Encouraging message (since this is diagnostic)
     * 3 progressive hints (easy ‚Üí medium ‚Üí detailed)
     * Correct answer feedback with encouragement
     * Incorrect answer support (gentle, since they haven't learned it yet)
     * Teaching moment preview (what they'll learn next)

2. INSTRUCTION PHASE (ADAPTIVE - Based on practice performance):
   - Engaging title ${career ? `with ${student.display_name} as the ${career.name}` : ''}
   - Personal greeting: ${career ? `"Welcome, ${career.name} ${student.display_name}!"` : `"Welcome, ${student.display_name}!"`}
   - Clear concept explanation showing ${career ? `how you as a ${career.name} use ${skill.skill_name}` : `${skill.skill_name}`}
   - 3 step-by-step examples ${career ? `from a ${career.name}'s daily work` : 'with clear explanations'}
   ${practiceResults ? '- Focus on areas where student struggled in practice' : ''}

   ${practiceResults && practiceResults.correct >= practiceResults.total * 0.8 ? '- Can move quickly to advanced concepts' : ''}

3. ASSESSMENT PHASE (VALIDATION):
   - 1 comprehensive assessment question  
   - MUST BE DIFFERENT from practice questions
   - Tests understanding of what was taught in instruction
   - Include visual field with CAREER-APPROPRIATE emojis if it's a counting question
   - 4 multiple choice options
   - Detailed explanation
   - Encouraging success message
   - MUST use industry-appropriate items and scenarios ONLY

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ${student.display_name}'s name throughout
- Grade ${student.grade_level} appropriate language:
  ${student.grade_level === 'K' ? '‚Ä¢ Kindergarten: Very simple words, short sentences, basic concepts only' :
    student.grade_level === '1' ? '‚Ä¢ Grade 1: Simple vocabulary, clear sentences, foundational concepts' :
    student.grade_level === '2' ? '‚Ä¢ Grade 2: Basic vocabulary, straightforward explanations' :
    '‚Ä¢ Age-appropriate vocabulary and complexity'}
- Include fun emojis and visual elements
- Keep explanations brief and clear
- Make it educational, fun, and achievable
- Ensure content builds understanding progressively
${student.grade_level === 'K' || student.grade_level === '1' || student.grade_level === '2' ? 
  '- IMPORTANT: Avoid complex medical/technical terms for young learners' : ''}

  performanceLevel === 'intermediate' ?
  '- Reinforces concepts with focus on struggled areas' :
  '- Provides thorough foundational teaching with extra support'}

1. PERSONALIZED GREETING:
   - Acknowledge practice performance appropriately
   - Set expectations for what they'll learn
   - Use ${student.display_name}'s name
   ${career ? `- Reference how ${career.name}s use this skill` : ''}

2. CONCEPT EXPLANATION (NOT practice questions!):

   - Show the thinking process, not just answer
   ${performanceLevel === 'foundational' ? '- Start with very basic examples' : ''}
   ${performanceLevel === 'advanced' ? '- Include challenging applications' : ''}
   - Examples should BUILD understanding progressively

IMPORTANT:
- This is a TEACHING phase, not testing
- Examples should SHOW and EXPLAIN, not quiz
- Use "Let me show you..." not "Can you solve..."
- Examples format: "Here's how to..." with full explanation
- Make it feel like a friendly tutor explaining concepts

- Never use numbers greater than 3 in any discovery activity
- All counting explorations must involve 3 items or fewer
- Examples: ‚úÖ "You discover 2 patterns", ‚úÖ "You find 3 clues", ‚ùå "You explore 5 options"` : ''}

CRITICAL: Write everything in SECOND PERSON ("You discover...", "You explore...", "Your investigation...")
The student is actively discovering - they're the explorer, the scientist, the innovator!

Design a discovery journey where the student explores as a ${career ? career.name : 'curious explorer'}:

1. EXPLORATION THEME:
   - "You're investigating how ${career ? `${career.name}s` : 'professionals'} use ${skill.skill_name}..."
   - Questions written as "What would YOU discover if...?"
   - "Your mission is to explore..."

2. DISCOVERY PATHS:
   - 3 paths written as "You can explore..."
   - Activities written as "You will..." or "Your task is..."
   - Instructions as "You need to..." or "Try to..."
   - Outcomes as "You discovered that..."

3. CONNECTIONS:
   - "You learned earlier that..."
   - "As a ${career ? career.name : 'professional'}, you used this when..."
   - "Next, you might want to explore..."

REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS use second person ("You explore", "You discover", "Your investigation")
- NEVER use third person ("${student.display_name} explores", "${student.display_name} discovers")
- Age-appropriate discovery for grade ${student.grade_level}
- Make the student feel they ARE the explorer/innovator
- Show how THEY discover new uses for ${skill.skill_name}
