ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Continue the storyline from the LEARN container

${studentName} just learned "${skillName}" in the LEARN container.
Now create NARRATIVE WORKPLACE SCENARIOS that show how ${studentName} uses this newly learned skill to make good workday decisions as a ${career}.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
âœ“ NARRATIVE FORMAT: Tell a story about ${studentName}'s workday as a ${career}
âœ“ SKILL APPLICATION: Show how the newly learned skill (${skillName}) helps make professional decisions
âœ“ WORKDAY DECISIONS: Each scenario is a realistic workplace situation requiring decision-making
âœ“ STORY CONTINUITY: Continue the narrative established in the Master Narrative
âœ“ REALISTIC CHOICES: Options represent authentic professional actions a ${career} would take

Create realistic workplace scenarios where ${studentName}:
â€¢ Experiences a typical workday situation as a ${career}
â€¢ Faces a decision that ${career}s encounter in real work
â€¢ Uses the newly learned skill (${skillName}) to make the right choice
â€¢ Sees the outcome of making good professional decisions

TONE: Narrative storytelling that immerses ${studentName} in the ${career} workplace
FORMAT: Story-based scenarios with realistic decision choices
FOCUS: How newly learned skills help make good workday decisions

Language must be appropriate for grade ${gradeLevel}.
