/**
 * Demonstrative Master Narrative Generator
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: FOR PARENT/TEACHER/ADMIN DASHBOARDS ONLY
 *
 * This generator is used for:
 * ‚úÖ Parent Dashboard - Preview tomorrow's lessons
 * ‚úÖ Teacher Dashboard - Review and approve curriculum
 * ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard - Content approval workflows
 * ‚úÖ Marketing/Sales - Demonstrate product capabilities
 * ‚úÖ Onboarding - Show value before purchase
 *
 * DO NOT USE FOR:
 * ‚ùå Student Dashboard
 * ‚ùå Learn/Experience/Discover Containers
 * ‚ùå Actual lesson delivery
 *
 * For student learning, use: MasterNarrativeGenerator
 *
 * KEY DIFFERENCE:
 * - This uses SAMPLE careers (pre-selected for demonstration)
 * - Real generator uses STUDENT'S CHOSEN career (after Screen 4)
 *
 * Creates showcase lesson plans for parent approval that highlight Pathfinity's full potential
 * These enhancements will be retrofitted back into the main MasterNarrativeGenerator
