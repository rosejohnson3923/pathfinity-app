  # Fix RLS Policy Performance Issues Across All Tables

  This migration optimizes all RLS policies by wrapping auth.uid() calls
  with SELECT statements to prevent re-evaluation for each row.
  
  Changes:
  - auth.uid() â†’ (select auth.uid())
  - Maintains exact same security logic
  - Improves query performance at scale
