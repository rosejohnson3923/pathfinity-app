# Component Remounting Fix Test Plan

## Changes Made
1. âœ… Added React.memo to MultiSubjectContainer to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. âœ… Added proper key props to AILearnContainer, AIExperienceContainer, and AIDiscoverContainer
3. âœ… Added cleanup for companionVoiceoverService when AILearnContainer unmounts
4. âœ… Added React.memo to AICharacterProvider to prevent cascading re-renders

## Test Steps

### 1. Initial Load Test
- Open the app at http://localhost:3002
- Login with a test user
- Navigate to the Practice phase
- Check console for initialization messages
- **Expected**: Components should initialize only once, not multiple times

### 2. Voice Loop Test
- Complete the Introduction modal
- Select a companion (e.g., Harmony)
- Select a career
- Navigate to CareerInc Lobby
- Click "LEARN" container to start
- Navigate to Practice phase
- **Expected**: No repeating voice saying "Continue your journey of discovery"

### 3. Component Mount Test
- Open browser DevTools Console
- Look for these log messages:
  - "ðŸŽ“ StudentDashboard: Passing grade to AICharacterProvider"
  - "ðŸŽ¯ MultiSubjectContainer rendering"
  - "AICharacterProvider re-initialized"
- **Expected**: Each message should appear only once per navigation, not 10+ times

### 4. Practice Question Flow Test
- Answer a practice question
- Click Submit
- Wait for feedback
- Click Next Question
- **Expected**: 
  - Feedback displays as toast notification
  - No component remounting between questions
  - Voice feedback plays once, not repeatedly

### 5. Navigation Test
- Navigate from Practice back to Lobby
- Return to Practice
- **Expected**: 
  - Voice stops when leaving Practice
  - Components initialize cleanly when returning
  - No lingering voice from previous session

## Key Indicators of Success
- âœ… No "Continue your journey of discovery" voice loop
- âœ… Console shows single initialization, not multiple
- âœ… AI Companion feedback appears as toast notifications
- âœ… Submit/Next button flow works without getting stuck
- âœ… Voice stops properly when navigating away

## Console Commands for Debugging
```javascript
// Check if companion voiceover is playing
companionVoiceoverService.isVoiceoverEnabled()

// Stop all voice manually if needed
companionVoiceoverService.stopCurrent()

// Check component render count (add to component if needed)
console.log('Component rendered:', ++window.renderCount)
```

## If Issues Persist
1. Check for any parent components causing re-renders
2. Verify React.memo is working by checking prop changes
3. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify unnecessary renders
4. Check if state updates in parent components are causing cascading updates
